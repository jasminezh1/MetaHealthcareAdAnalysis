"Pharmacies Shared Patient Records Without a Warrant, an Inquiry Finds
A congressional investigation found that the nation’s largest pharmacies have handed over prescription records to law enforcement without a warrant, raising privacy concerns.
Law enforcement agencies have obtained the prescription records of thousands of Americans from the country’s largest pharmacy chains without a warrant, a congressional inquiry found, raising concerns about how the companies handle patient privacy.

Three of the largest pharmacy groups — CVS Health, Kroger and Rite Aid — do not require their staff members to contact a lawyer before releasing information requested by law enforcement, the inquiry found. The other five — Walgreens, Cigna, Optum Rx, Walmart and Amazon — said that they do require a legal review before honoring such requests.

The policies were revealed on Tuesday in a letter to Xavier Becerra, the secretary of health and human services, from Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representatives Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Sara Jacobs of California, all Democrats.

The inquiry began in June, a year after the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion and cleared the way for Republican-controlled states to enact near-total bans on the procedure. Reproductive health advocates and some lawmakers have since raised privacy concerns regarding access to birth control and abortion medication.

“Although pharmacies are legally permitted to tell their customers about government demands for their data, most don’t,” the lawmakers wrote. “As a result, many Americans’ prescription records have few meaningful privacy protections, and those protections vary widely depending on which pharmacy they use.”

More on Abortion Issues in America
Abortion Pill Case: The Supreme Court announced that it would decide on the availability of a commonly used abortion pill — the first major case involving abortion on its docket since it overturned the constitutional right to the procedure.
Texas Case: The Texas Supreme Court overturned a lower court order that allowed an abortion for a woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition, hours after she decided to leave the state for the procedure.
On the Ballot: After voters in Ohio approved a measure to enshrine abortion rights in the State Constitution, could Florida be next?
Crossing the Border: American women are traveling to Mexico for abortions, crystallizing the shifting policies of two nations that once held vastly different positions on the procedure.
The inquiry found that the pharmacies receive tens of thousands of legal requests annually for their patients’ pharmacy records. However, the letter said, the companies indicated that a vast majority of the requests were submitted in connection with civil litigation.

In July, nearly 50 Democratic members of Congress wrote to Mr. Becerra to urge the Health and Human Services Department to expand regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, that would require law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant to gain access to medical records and would require that patients be notified when their records are requested.

Since then, lawmakers have been digging into the disclosure practices of major pharmacy chains.

During the congressional inquiry, CVS, Kroger and Rite Aid “indicated that their pharmacy staff face extreme pressure to immediately respond to law enforcement demands and, as such, the companies instruct their staff to process those requests in the store,” Mr. Wyden, Ms. Jayapal and Ms. Jacobs wrote in their letter to Mr. Becerra.

“Americans’ prescription records are among the most private information the government can obtain about a person,” the lawmakers wrote. “They can reveal extremely personal and sensitive details about a person’s life.”

It went on to urge the Health and Human Services Department to strengthen the regulations under HIPAA “to more closely align them with Americans’ reasonable expectations of privacy and constitutional principles.”

“Pharmacies can and should insist on a warrant, and invite law enforcement agencies that insist on demanding patient medical records with solely a subpoena to go to court to enforce that demand,” the letter said.

In a statement, a CVS spokeswoman said that the company’s “processes are consistent with HIPAA” and that its pharmacy teams are trained to “appropriately respond to lawful requests.”

“We have suggested a warrant or judge-issued subpoena requirement be considered and we look forward to working cooperatively with Congress to strengthen patient privacy protections,” the spokeswoman, Amy Thibault, said.

The Health and Human Services Department has already taken steps to add language to HIPAA that would protect data involving reproductive health. In April, the department’s Office for Civil Rights proposed a rule that would bar health care providers and insurers from turning over information to state officials who are trying to prosecute someone for seeking or providing a legal abortion.

Michelle Mello, a professor of law and health policy at Stanford, said that requiring a warrant instead of a subpoena for the release of pharmacy records would “not necessarily preclude concerns” about privacy. She also said that notifying patients about record disclosures, which the lawmakers said “would be a major step forward for patient transparency,” would likely occur only after the fact.

While Professor Mello said most pharmacy records should be kept private, she said that targeting pharmacy employees, who could be found in contempt of court for not complying with a law enforcement demand for records, adds another layer of complexity.

“It’s not fair to put the onus on them to be found in contempt of court and then fight that,” she said.

But efforts by congressional Democrats to shore up HIPAA reveal a longstanding misconception about the health care privacy law, which was signed into law in 1996, she said.

“People think HIPAA has broader protection than it does,” Professor Mello said. “It wasn’t designed to enable health care providers to resist very misguided, in my view, attempts to enforce laws that impact patients in a negative way.”

"Supreme Court Will Hear Challenge to Abortion Pill Access
The justices announced that they would hear a case challenging a federal agency’s approval of the commonly used pill.
The Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it would decide on the availability of a commonly used abortion pill, the first major case involving abortion on its docket since it overturned the constitutional right to the procedure more than a year ago.

The Biden administration had asked the justices to intervene after a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit favored curbing distribution of the drug, mifepristone, appearing skeptical of the Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the pill in recent years. In its ruling, the panel said that the pill would remain legal, but with significant restrictions on patients’ access, including prohibiting the medication from being sent by mail or prescribed by telemedicine.

The move sets up a high-stakes fight over the drug that could sharply curtail access to the medication, even in states where abortion remains legal. It could also have implications for the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration, which approved the pill more than two decades ago.

The Supreme Court is now in the unusual position of ruling on abortion access even after its conservative majority declared that it would leave that question to elected officials. Until the court issues a decision, the F.D.A.’s approval of the drug remains in place, delaying the potential for abrupt limits on a medication that is used in more than half of all pregnancy terminations in the United States.

The Supreme Court did not set a date for argument but is expected to issue a decision by the end of its term, in late June. That means a ruling could arrive at the heart of the campaign season, during which abortion is expected to be a centerpiece of Democratic platforms.

Abortion rights groups welcomed the court’s decision to hear the case.

“The stakes are enormous in post-Roe America,” Nancy Northup, the president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy organization, said in a statement.

Alliance Defending Freedom, the group that is representing those challenging the F.D.A.’s authority, said in a statement that the court would help settle whether “the F.D.A. has harmed the health of women and undermined the rule of law by illegally removing every meaningful safeguard from the chemical abortion drug regimen.”

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, the battle over abortion has largely played out in the states, where it remains a potent political and legal issue.

More than a dozen states have enacted bans or restrictions, and Democrats have seized on the fallout from the ruling to galvanize voters at the polls, even in conservative-leaning states. In Texas, a woman sought an emergency court order to receive an abortion but ultimately was denied by the state’s Supreme Court and left the state to undergo the procedure. And in Ohio, voters in November soundly approved a ballot measure that enshrined a right to abortion in its constitution. The success of similar campaigns has inspired efforts in Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania.

The justices had discussed the case at their Friday conference, the private meeting among the nine. They will hear two consolidated cases challenging more recent changes the F.D.A. made starting in 2016 to expand distribution of the drug, F.D.A. v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, No. 23-235, and Danco Laboratories v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, No. 23-236.

In asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, lawyers for the Justice Department described the ruling by the appeals court as unprecedented in questioning the expert judgment of the F.D.A. Such a decision, they added, “would threaten to severely disrupt the pharmaceutical industry and prevent F.D.A. from fulfilling its statutory responsibilities according to its scientific judgment.”

Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal advocacy organization that has brought cases for clients opposed to abortion and gay and transgender rights, represents the challengers. In a brief, lawyers for the group argued that the Supreme Court did not need to weigh in, calling the appeals court decision a “modest decision” that “merely restores the common-sense safeguards under which millions of women have taken chemical abortion drugs.”

The tangled showdown over the future of the pill reflects how medication abortion has become the next major battlefront for conservative groups.

The case began in November last year, when an umbrella group of anti-abortion medical organizations and a few doctors filed a lawsuit describing the F.D.A.’s approval as flawed and questioning the safety of the drug.

Many studies of mifepristone have found it to be highly safe and effective, and years of research have shown that serious complications are rare. Fewer than 1 percent of patients need hospitalization, medical experts have said.

The drug, the first in a two-part regimen, has been used by more than five million people in the United States and is approved for use in dozens of countries. Under the current F.D.A. regulatory framework for mifepristone, it has been regulated more strictly and studied more strenuously than most other drugs.

The group filed its challenge in the Panhandle city of Amarillo, Texas, where only one federal judge hears civil lawsuits filed there, Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who is a longtime opponent of abortion.

In April, Judge Kacsmaryk issued a preliminary ruling invalidating the F.D.A.’s approval of the drug. Days later, a panel of three judges in the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, struck down part of his ruling, allowing the drug to remain on the market but with restrictions.

The Justice Department was among those that sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, which temporarily paused any changes to the drug’s availability as an appeal made its way up through the lower courts.

A different three-judge panel in the Fifth Circuit ruled in August that the F.D.A.’s original approval of mifepristone should remain in place, as should its approval of a generic version in 2019.

But it rolled back regulations governing the pill, to before 2016. In the years since, the agency made changes that broadened access to the drug. Under those pre-2016 rules, mifepristone must be prescribed only by a doctor and picked up in person. Patients also had to visit a doctor three times during the abortion process."

"Dr. John A. Talbott, Champion of Care for the Mentally Ill, Dies at 88
A psychiatrist and a prolific author, he criticized what he referred to as a “nonsystem” that left vulnerable people on the streets to fend for themselves.
Dr. John A. Talbott, a psychiatrist who championed the care of vulnerable populations of the mentally ill, especially the homeless — many of whom were left to fend for themselves in the nation’s streets, libraries, bus terminals and jails after mass closures of state mental hospitals — died on Nov. 29 at his home in Baltimore. He was 88.

His wife, Susan Talbott, confirmed the death.

Dr. Talbott was an early backer of a movement known as deinstitutionalization, which pushed to replace America’s decrepit mental hospitals with community-based treatment. But he became one of the movement’s most powerful critics after a lack of money and political will stranded thousands of the deeply disturbed without proper care.

“The chronic mentally ill patient had his locus of living and care transferred from a single lousy institution to multiple wretched ones,” Dr. Talbott wrote in the journal Hospital and Community Psychiatry in 1979.

In a career of more than 60 years, Dr. Talbott held many of the leading positions in his field. He was president of the American Psychiatric Association; director of a large urban mental hospital, Dunlap-Manhattan Psychiatric Center, on Wards Island; chairman of the department of psychiatry at the University of Maryland, Baltimore; and editor of three prominent journals: Psychiatric Quarterly, Psychiatric Services and The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease — which he was editing at his death.

Dr. Talbott exerted influence not as a researcher of the brain or neurological drugs but as a hospital leader, an academic and a member of blue-ribbon panels — including President Jimmy Carter’s Commission on Mental Health — and, especially, through prolific writings. A clear and muscular polemicist, he wrote, edited or contributed to more than 50 books.

“I admired him for taking the directorship of Manhattan State Hospital and his belief that psychiatrists should take the hard jobs and not just do private practice on the Upper West Side,” Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a prominent psychiatrist and the founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center in Arlington, Va., said in an email.

In 1984, during Dr. Talbott’s presidency, the American Psychiatric Association released its first major study of the homeless mentally ill. The study found that the practice of discharging patients from state hospitals into ill-prepared communities was “a major societal tragedy.”

“Hardly a section of the country, urban or rural, has escaped the ubiquitous presence of ragged, ill and hallucinating human beings, wandering through our city streets, huddled in alleyways or sleeping over vents,” the report said. It estimated that up to 50 percent of homeless people had chronic mental illnesses.

Six years earlier, Dr. Talbott had published a book, “The Death of the Asylum,” which railed against both the broken system of state hospitals and the broken policies that replaced them.

In an interview with The New York Times in 1984, he acknowledged that psychiatrists who had championed community-based treatment as an alternative to institutions, including himself, bore part of the blame.

“The psychiatrists involved in the policymaking at that time certainly oversold community treatment, and our credibility today is probably damaged because of it,” he said.

In an account of Dr. Talbott’s career submitted to a medical journal after his death, a former colleague, Dr. Allen Frances, wrote, “Few people have ever had so distinguished a career as Dr. Talbott, but perhaps none has ever had a more frustrating and disappointing one.”

Dr. Frances, the chairman emeritus of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, explained in an interview that Dr. Talbott had been a leader in the field of “community psychiatry,” which held that mental illness was influenced by social conditions — not just a biological disposition — and that treatments required taking into account a patient’s living conditions and the range of services available.

Community psychiatry was supposed to be the alternative for patients no longer warehoused in run-down, often abusive state hospitals. A new generation of drugs held promise that patients could live at least semi-independently.

“They were working hard to get psychiatry to be less stodgy, less biological, less psychoanalytical and more socially and community oriented,” Dr. Frances said of Dr. Talbott and others who championed community psychiatry.

But the high hopes for robust outpatient treatment in community settings were never adequately realized. The Community Mental Health Act, a 1963 law championed by President John F. Kennedy, envisioned 2,000 community mental health centers by 1980. Fewer than half that many had been opened by then, as funding failed to materialize or was diverted elsewhere.

At the same time, deinstitutionalization cut the number of patients in state hospitals by 75 percent, to fewer than 140,000 in 1980 from 560,000 in 1955.

“The disaster occurred because our mental health delivery system is not a system but a nonsystem,” Dr. Talbott wrote in 1979.

John Andrew Talbott was born on Nov. 8, 1935, in Boston. His mother, Mildred (Cherry) Talbott, was a homemaker. His father, Dr. John Harold Talbott, was a professor of medicine and an editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association.

In 1961, Dr. Talbott married Susan Webster, who had a career as a nurse and hospital administrator, after the couple met during intermission at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.

Along with his wife, Dr. Talbott is survived by two daughters, Sieglinde Peterson and Alexandra Morrel; six grandchildren; and a sister, Cherry Talbott.

He graduated from Harvard College in 1957 and received his M.D. from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1961. He did further training at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital/New York State Psychiatric Institute and the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research.

Drafted during the Vietnam War, he served as a captain in the Medical Corps in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968. He received a Bronze Star for persuading troops to take their malaria pills.

“The reason they weren’t taking them was because a case of malaria was a ticket home,” he later explained. “Then I scared the hell out of them by showing them examples of what malaria could lead to.”

Once he was home, Dr. Talbott became active in the antiwar movement. He was a spokesman for Vietnam Veterans Against the War at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The next year he helped organize a protest at Riverside Church in Manhattan in which the names of soldiers killed in Vietnam were read aloud by a procession of speakers, including Edward I. Koch, Leonard Bernstein and Lauren Bacall.

After retiring as chairman of psychiatry at the University of Maryland in 2000 after 15 years, Dr. Talbott indulged a lifelong appreciation for fine dining by contributing to online food sites. In 2006, he began a blog, John Talbott’s Paris, in which he chronicled meals he ate on frequent visits to the French capital."
"SmileDirectClub Shuts Down After Filing for Bankruptcy
The telehealth company, which sold teeth alignment devices to two million customers, was unprofitable and had been criticized by medical groups.
SmileDirectClub, a telehealth company that sold teeth-straightening devices through the mail and faced criticism from medical groups, said on Friday that it had shut down.

The company, founded in 2014, sold teeth aligners online and in its shops for $1,850. It marketed them as a faster, cheaper alternative to braces. SmileDirectClub’s initial public offering in 2019 valued it at $8.9 billion.

SmileDirectClub served more than two million customers over nearly a decade. But the company was not profitable and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September with nearly $900 million of debt, court filings and financial statements show. And this year, it settled a lawsuit from the District of Columbia attorney general’s office that had accused the company of using confidentiality clauses to stifle consumer criticism.

On Friday, SmileDirectClub said on its website that it was shutting down its global operations immediately. It apologized to customers for the inconvenience, and urged them to consult a doctor or dentist about future treatment.

Outstanding orders have been canceled, the company said. Customers on a monthly installment payment plan are expected to continue making all of their payments. Those who have completed treatment will no longer qualify for the free touch-ups that the company had guaranteed.

For customers seeking refunds, SmileDirectClub said that it would have more information “once the bankruptcy process determines next steps.”

SmileDirectClub was founded in Nashville by childhood friends Alex Fenkell and Jordan Katzman. To order its products, customers made a mold of their teeth at home with a kit mailed by the company or had their teeth scanned at a “SmileShop” retail location. The scans were reviewed by dentists and orthodontists in the company’s network.

SmileDirectClub’s services, which did not require in-person visits, had drawn criticism from dentist and orthodontist groups. The company has sued some of those critics and accused California’s dental board of stifling competition.

After the company went public, its shares traded at about $18 apiece but later became a penny stock. As the company failed to turn a profit, it also dealt with legal fights throughout its existence and dissatisfied customers who accused it of false advertising and of violating Food and Drug Administration regulations.

SmileDirectClub offered refunds within 30 days after its aligners arrived, but anything after that was considered outside the company’s official refund policy and came with a nondisclosure provision, The New York Times reported in 2020. The agreement prohibited customers from telling others about the refund and required them to delete negative social media posts and reviews.

The District of Columbia attorney general’s office sued the company in 2022, accusing it of blocking customers who had been harmed by its products from filing complaints with regulators or law enforcement. Under a settlement to resolve the litigation earlier this year, SmileDirectClub was required to release more than 17,000 customers from the agreements and pay $500,000 to the district. The company said in the settlement that it had not violated the law or engaged in unfair or deceptive practices.

"Fund for Nuclear Waste Exposure Victims in Limbo as Congress Balks at Cost
Bipartisan efforts to extend and expand a program granting compensation to victims of government-caused nuclear contamination are faltering. It is set to expire in June.
More than two decades ago, Congress declared that victims of government-caused nuclear contamination who developed cancer and other serious illnesses — including uranium miners and those exposed to radiation from Manhattan Project-era atomic tests — should receive federal compensation.

“The health of the individuals who were unwitting participants in these tests was put at risk to serve the national security interests of the United States,” read the law enacted in 1990. “The United States should recognize and assume responsibility for the harm done to these individuals.”

Now that statute, known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, is in peril, set to expire in June without a clear path for renewal. And an effort to broaden it substantially beyond Cold War-era victims, to others who have been harmed by the aftereffects in the decades since, has run into a brick wall on Capitol Hill.

The Senate voted overwhelmingly in July to attach legislation renewing and expanding the program to the annual defense policy bill. But in the final version negotiated behind doors by congressional leaders, that measure, sponsored by Senators Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Ben Ray Luján, Democrat of New Mexico, was dropped.

Republicans objected to its hefty price tag, which congressional scorekeepers estimated could top $100 billion.

In an angry floor speech on Thursday, Mr. Hawley said the move amounted to Congress “rescinding” the apology it had made to victims decades ago.

“That allows this program to expire,” he said. “That turns its back on the tens of thousands of good Americans who have sacrificed for their country, who have dutifully given their health and in many cases their lives to this country, and gotten nothing.”
The original legislation was written with a narrow scope, meant to compensate those who participated in or were present for aboveground atomic bomb testing, a hallmark of the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, or uranium miners who worked between 1942 and 1971.

The law has paid out more than $2.5 billion in benefits to more than 55,000 claimants since its creation in 1990, according to congressional researchers. Claimants, who can include children or grandchildren of those who would have benefited from the program but have since died, receive a one-time payment ranging from $50,000 to $100,000.

The updated version by Mr. Hawley and Mr. Luján would expand the number of people eligible to receive compensation, and also increase the highest payout to $150,000. The law currently restricts eligibility for “down-winders,” or people who lived near one of the test sites, to those who resided in a handful of counties in Utah, Nevada and Arizona.

“The members that worked on this policy once upon a time, they left out states like New Mexico — and not just the entire state,” Mr. Luján, who has pushed to expand eligibility to individuals in most western states, said in an interview. “They left out the entire county where the first bomb was tested. That alone shows the people have been left out.”

The bill, which President Biden has endorsed, makes the case that the federal government should compensate anyone grievously sickened by the legacy of the nation’s nuclear weapons program.

It would extend access to the federal fund for 19 years and expand eligibility to Missourians sickened by radioactive waste that was never properly disposed of — and in some cases left out in the open near a creek — in St. Louis, the home of a uranium processing site in the 1940s.

A blockbuster report by The Missouri Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press earlier this year found that generations of families growing up in the area have since faced “rare cancers, autoimmune disorders and other mysterious illnesses they have come to believe were the result of exposure to its waters and sediment.”

It wasn’t until 2016 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised residents to avoid the creek entirely, and cleanup is expected to take until 2038.

“It is true that the Manhattan Project is in the past and the Cold War-era nuclear testing is in the past,” Mr. Hawley said in an interview. “But people are still dealing with the consequences of that.”

Unless Congress passes new legislation extending the law, the fund will shut down in June. Republican leaders in both the House and Senate objected to including it in the annual defense bill, citing a report by the Congressional Budget Office estimating that the proposed renewal would introduce $140 billion in new, mandatory spending.

Mr. Hawley and Mr. Luján said they had sought to whittle down the legislation to decrease costs, but that Republicans maintained that the billions of dollars involved would still be untenable.

Congress could still try to pass the legislation on its own, but it is increasingly rare for single-issue bills to make it through both chambers and to Mr. Biden’s desk. That is why the pair had attempted to use the hulking annual defense bill, regarded as a must-pass item, to push it through. Now they are regrouping.

“Every option is on the table to be able to get this done,” Mr. Luján said.

"Genes That Boost Fertility Also Shorten Our Life, Study Suggests
A study of DNA from half a million volunteers supports an old evolutionary theory about why our bodies eventually wear out.
Why do we grow old and die?

In the 19th century, the German biologist August Weismann argued that the machinery of life inevitably wore out with time. Death had evolved “for the need of the species,” he declared. It cleared away weak, old individuals so they wouldn’t compete with young ones.

That explanation never made sense to George Williams, an American evolutionary biologist. Natural selection acts only on the genes that are passed down from one generation to the next. What happens at the end of an animal’s life can have no effect on the course of evolution.

It occurred to Williams that growing old might instead be an inescapable side effect of natural selection. In 1957, he proposed a new theory: Genetic mutations that increased an animal’s fertility could also cause harm late in life. Over many generations, those mutations would create a burden that would lead eventually to death.

A new study, published on Friday in the journal Science Advances, bolsters Williams’s theory using a trove of human DNA. Researchers found hundreds of mutations that could boost a young person’s fertility and that were linked to bodily damage later in life.

Smaller studies in the past had already offered some support for Williams’s theory. In 2007, for example, a team of researchers studying a tiny worm found a pair of mutations that lengthened the creature’s life while cutting down its average number of offspring.

But Jianzhi Zhang, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Michigan, was not satisfied with these experiments. “These are case studies,” he said. “We don’t know if in the entire genome there are lots of such mutations.”

Dr. Zhang tapped into the UK Biobank, a database containing genetic material from half a million volunteers in Britain, along with information on their health and life experiences. The biobank has permitted scientists to uncover subtle links between genetic variations and thousands of traits such as high blood pressure, schizophrenia and a habit of smoking.

Working with Dr. Erping Long, a medical researcher now at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dr. Zhang pored over the database for information about reproduction and longevity. The scientists found that the genetic variations linked to fertility, such as the number of children a volunteer had, were also linked to a shorter life span.

What’s more, variants that affected reproduction were almost five times more likely to influence longevity than were variants that had nothing to do with reproduction. And variants good for reproduction were far more likely to be bad for long life.

Dr. Zhang and Dr. Long also found that volunteers with a large number of reproduction-promoting variants had slightly lower odds of surviving to age 76. Taken together, all of these results suggest that George Williams was correct, and that aging is essentially a side effect of natural selection’s impact on fertility. “They all point in the same direction,” Dr. Zhang said.

He and Dr. Long also found evidence hinting that this evolution did not stop sometime in our distant past. People in the database who were born in 1965 carried a greater number of reproduction-boosting variants than did people born in 1940.

The idea that fertility variants shorten life span might seem like a paradox, given how much longer people are living these days. In Britain, for example, the average life expectancy is about 80 years, up from 59 years a century ago.

Dr. Zhang noted that the mutations he and Dr. Long identified each had a tiny influence on a person’s longevity. As the variants have become more common, the environment has changed drastically, with better food and medicine lowering childhood mortality and helping more people reach older ages.

Steven Austad, an expert on aging at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who was not involved in the study, said that detecting the effect of these variants even though life expectancy had increased made the results all the more impressive.

“The pattern is so strong that it comes through these major changes to our life histories in modern times,” he said."
"What the ‘Mystery’ Canine Illness Means for Your Dog
We asked vets how to keep pets safe from respiratory disease this holiday season.

As an unidentified canine respiratory illness continues to pop up in clusters around the United States — causing symptoms like cough, fever and lethargy, and in more serious cases, hospitalization or death — many dog owners are wondering what steps they should take to keep their pets safe.

Despite the alarming headlines about fatalities, veterinarians are urging pet owners to be careful, but not to panic.

“At this point in time, I don’t think there is reason for extreme alarm,” said Dr. Deborah Silverstein, a professor of small animal emergency and critical care medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Ryan Veterinary Hospital. “I do think it’s a time to be cautious and to stay informed.”

We talked to Dr. Silverstein and other experts about the strategies they recommend (and in some cases, are using in their own homes) to protect dogs’ health.

Know your dog’s risk factors.
Though it is unclear whether the “mystery illness” is a new pathogen or a resurgence of a known bacterial or viral infection, dog owners should ensure their pets are up-to-date on their vaccinations, Dr. Silverstein said.

Be mindful that some dogs are at higher risk for more serious complications if they get sick.

“The animals we really worry about getting severe infections are those that don’t have a good immune system,” Dr. Silverstein said. “So those would be very young animals, especially if they have not had a full series of vaccines, or very old animals, because they’re more likely to have comorbidities or other diseases that may weaken their immune system.”

Brachycephalic or short-nosed breeds, like pugs and French and English bulldogs, also tend to have a harder time clearing respiratory tract infections, Dr. Silverstein said.

Exercise caution around other dogs.
The surest way to keep dogs safe is to isolate them from other dogs, said Dr. Renee McDougall, a specialist surgeon with Bond Vet. She and her husband have a five-year-old pit bull mix, Rupert, who adores walks and sniffing other dogs. But for the past three weeks, she said, the couple have kept him from engaging in any “nose-to-nose greetings.”

“My dog is so sad!” Dr. McDougall admitted.

“We know how this disease typically spreads is through droplets and face-to-face interactions,” she said. “So if we just avoid those scenarios, we’re probably being as safe as we possibly can be.”

But if you rely on doggy day care while you are at work, for instance, or if you intend to board your dog over the holidays, certain measures may help mitigate the risks in group settings.

Doggy day cares or boarding facilities:
Ask about the facility’s vaccine requirements and its screening policies, the two experts said.

“Make sure that they’re following strict guidelines with any dogs that are allowed in the building,” Dr. Silverstein said. “If they show up, and they have a cough or a sneeze, they should not be let in.” Though she cautioned that dogs probably shed the virus before they show any symptoms.

Dr. McDougall recommended asking about the size of the group your dog will be spending time in. Is it, say, 30 dogs running around together? Will different dogs be present every day? Smaller, consistent groupings are better, she said. And ideally, dogs should not share toys or water bowls.

“You’re the dog parent,” Dr. McDougall said, acknowledging that many owners rely on outside facilities to care for their pups. “You decide how much risk you’re willing to take.”

Dog parks:
Dog parks are already somewhat controversial, Dr. Silverstein said, though she knows how beloved they can be.

But right now, she said it was “safest to stay away from other dogs whose health status and vaccine status is unknown,” unless you are certain there is “very little incidence of disease” in your area. (Cases have been reported in several states, including Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon and Rhode Island, but the number is growing and the illness is most likely more widespread, experts say.) Some communities have temporarily closed dog parks.

As an alternative, Dr. Silverstein said dog owners might consider having a “play date” with another dog whose health and vaccine status they know — though there is no guarantee of safety.

When in doubt, reach out to your vet.
The vets we spoke to emphasized that pet owners should talk to their veterinarians if they have questions about whether there have been cases locally, or if they need help weighing their pet’s risks.

Contact your veterinarian if you notice your dog coughing or experiencing nasal or eye discharge, Dr. Silverstein said. If your pet is otherwise eating and acting normally, the vet may advise monitoring it at home for 24 to 48 hours or may schedule a telehealth visit, Dr. McDougall said.

Dogs who seem lethargic or who are having difficulty breathing need immediate attention.

Dr. Silverstein and Dr. McDougall each said that veterinary practices were being careful to avoid exposure among patients, and acknowledged that many clinics and animal hospitals were backed up, so finding care may be easier said than done."
"He Was Diagnosed With Lyme Disease. Why Did the Treatment Have No Effect?
Shortly after he retired, the man’s health began to fail him. An accidental finding on a CT scan revealed the true culprit.

The couple couldn’t quite remember when the 61-year-old man started to get sick. Was it before he retired the previous spring? No — it was later, the man insisted. But both men agreed that they knew something was seriously wrong the day the recent retiree fell going up the stairs. He was carrying his new laptop when his right leg suddenly buckled. If he hadn’t had the computer, he might have been able to catch himself. Instead, holding his new machine aloft, he fell forward and slid down a couple of steps. He scraped his shins and forearms; blood seeped from the shallow wounds. And he was too weak to get up. “I need help,” he called to his partner upstairs. The man, already on his feet after hearing the thump, appeared almost instantly at his side.

He hefted his partner to his feet and half-carried him into the upstairs bathroom. “You really need to call your doctor,” he murmured as he dabbed the scrapes. He had been urging him to do this for weeks, ever since he noticed how easily his partner bruised, how strangely thin his skin looked. And there were other changes. He was quieter. His easy laugh had all but disappeared. Most worrisome, he seemed confused and forgetful; sometimes he didn’t make sense. They had been together for more than 40 years; the man knew his partner well. These changes scared him.

By the time the man agreed to see the doctor, he could barely move the leg that gave way on the stairs. His walk was an awkward shuffle, and he had to hold on to his partner as they made their way from the car to the medical center in Durham, Conn. The doctor on duty that day basically took one look at the bruised and limping man and sent him to Yale New Haven Hospital. At the very least the patient was going to need a scan. He would probably need more.

In the emergency room, a physical exam revealed that the muscles in his right thigh weren’t working at all. And the skin there was numb. His blood chemistries were out of whack — his potassium dangerously low. An M.R.I. of his entire spine provided no answers. He lived in a wooded area, not far from Lyme. Had he noticed a tick bite? Or a rash? No bites, but a friend had pointed out a rash earlier that summer. It was in a spot he couldn’t see, though, and he just forgot about it. A blood test and then a spinal tap confirmed the diagnosis: He had Lyme disease. Both men felt a shudder of relief. He would need a full month of antibiotics, but once he was treated, he should get better.

The Incidentaloma
But he didn’t. A month later he was still weak, still bruising and bleeding. He was tired; his thinking remained foggy. And his blood pressure was out of control. He had a history of hypertension, but it had always been well controlled on a single medication. Suddenly, it wasn’t. His primary-care doctor put him on a second drug, then a third, but his blood pressure remained higher than it had ever been. His doctor sent him to a cardiologist, who put the patient on even stronger blood-pressure medications. He also ordered an ultrasound of the man’s heart to make sure it was beating normally. It was, but the aorta looked strange. A CT scan reassured him that the man’s aorta was normal but did reveal an unexpected finding: On top of his left adrenal gland was a golf-ball-size mass.

Accidental findings on CT scans are so common they have a name — incidentalomas. Up to 7 percent of imaging studies of the abdomen will reveal an incidentaloma on one of the adrenal glands. Most of these masses are benign and don’t make any of the hormones normally produced by the adrenal gland. Still, all need to be evaluated. The cardiologist called the patient with the news and referred him to an endocrinologist at Yale.

Between the difficulty of scheduling an appointment with a subspecialist and an unexpected snowstorm, it was months before the patient was able to see the endocrinologist. But finally, on a chilly, overcast day in April, he and his partner found themselves in an exam room at Yale New Haven Hospital. The brisk, smiling endocrinologist strode in and introduced herself. The two men described their strange journey over the previous nine months. It started, they explained, that summer with what turned out to be Lyme disease. He was treated but never got better. Indeed, he felt even worse now. He was weak — he stopped going to the gym because he could no longer do the workout. The muscles on his arms and legs seemed to evaporate. He put on weight, but none of it was muscle. He had never had a belly like this. And he was exhausted even though he slept 10 to 12 hours a night.

The endocrinologist had already reviewed the man’s CT scan, as well as the M.R.I. done the summer before, and so she knew what she was looking for. This had nothing to do with his recent Lyme infection. The adrenal glands are responsible for providing several hormones, including the fight-or-flight hormones like adrenaline; cortisol, the hormone that regulates metabolism; and the fluid-balance hormone aldosterone. Excesses of any one of these could be responsible for his high blood pressure. His easy bruising and fragile skin suggested an excess of cortisol. His low potassium and elevated sodium could be caused by an excess of aldosterone. His rapid heart rate could be a sign of excess stress hormones. As the doctor examined him, she looked for clues to help her determine which hormone was being overproduced. His body was covered with bruises. His arms and legs were thin and the muscles wasted. His belly, in contrast, was soft and obese. He had pads of fat at the top of each shoulder and his face was puffy, red and round. This unusual collection of symptoms was classic for Cushing’s syndrome — caused by an excess of the metabolic hormone cortisol.

A Puzzling Contradiction
One aspect of his illness, however, was puzzling. These adrenal tumors usually grow slowly, taking years to create this much physical discord. But this man described symptoms that appeared suddenly and worsened quickly. And the tumor itself seemed to be growing fast. Although it wasn’t noticed at the time, a smaller version of the tumor was visible on the M.R.I. done the summer before. A cancer could grow this rapidly. Was this adrenal carcinoma? These aggressive cancers are rare — with only one or two cases found per million people each year — but they can be deadly.

The endocrinologist ordered a CT scan to be done that day. If this was a cancer, it should have grown in the months since his last scan. But even if it wasn’t cancer, it clearly needed to come out, and soon. She referred him to a surgeon. He had been sick with this growth long enough.

The labs confirmed what the endocrinologist suspected. The man’s level of cortisol was sky high — 25 times the normal amount. The CT scan showed no growth in the tumor size. That was a relief. Adrenal cancers often spread beyond the gland itself, and once that happens the chance of living more than five years plummets.

He had his surgery a month later. The response was immediate. The next day his blood pressure and heart rate were back to normal. His blood chemistries, including his cortisol level, were in the normal range. The overactive tumor had taken over the production of cortisol; his remaining adrenal gland was now on vacation, and it would take time for it to recover. In the meantime, he would need to take hydrocortisone.

The mass was examined in the lab. The endocrinologist was surprised to find that it was adrenal carcinoma after all. Both doctor and patient were relieved when a PET scan showed no signs of spread.

The rest of his recovery was slow. The bruises faded. His muscles reappeared and his endurance returned. By the end of the year he was able to start running again. He went for scans every few months, and after four and a half years he got what was supposed to be his final scan. But that scan showed a new lesion, on his spine. It was treated with radiation. The next year, just this fall, he had a hint of another lesion. A new metastasis. He and his doctors are discussing next steps.

I spoke with the patient recently. He has a good life, he told me. He feels great. When asked about the new lesion, he was thoughtful but optimistic. He’ll take care of these problems as they come up, he said. In the meantime, he will continue to enjoy the life he and his partner have together. He asked: What else can any of us do?"
"William P. Murphy Jr., Innovator of Life-Saving Medical Tools, Dies at 100
Dr. Murphy’s safe, reliable blood bag replaced breakable glass bottles used in transfusions in the Korean War. He also helped improve pacemakers and artificial kidneys.

Dr. William P. Murphy Jr., a biomedical engineer who was an inventor of the vinyl blood bag that replaced breakable bottles in the Korean War and made transfusions safe and reliable on battlefields, in hospitals and at scenes of natural disasters and accidents, died on Thursday at his home in Coral Gables, Fla. He was 100.

His death was confirmed on Monday by Mike Tomás, the president and chief executive of U.S. Stem Cell, a Florida company for which Dr. Murphy had long served as chairman. He became chairman emeritus last year.

Dr. Murphy, the son of a Nobel Prize-winning Boston physician, was also widely credited with early advances in the development of pacemakers to stabilize erratic heart rhythms, of artificial kidneys to cleanse the blood of impurities, and of many sterile devices, including trays, scalpel blades, syringes, catheters and other surgical and patient-care items that are used once and thrown away.

But Dr. Murphy was perhaps best known for his work on the modern blood bag: the sealed, flexible, durable and inexpensive container, made of polyvinyl chloride, that did away with fragile glass bottles and changed almost everything about the storage, portability and ease of delivering and transfusing blood supplies worldwide.

Developed with a colleague, Dr. Carl W. Walter, in 1949-50, the bags are light, wrinkle-resistant and tear proof. They are easy to handle, preserve red blood cells and proteins, and ensure that the blood is not exposed to the air for at least six weeks. Blood banks, hospitals and other medical storage facilities depend on their longevity. Drones drop them safely into remote areas.

In 1952, Dr. Murphy joined the United States Public Health Service as a consultant and, at the behest of the Army, went to Korea during the war there to demonstrate, with teams of medics, the use of the blood bags in transfusing wounded soldiers at aid stations near the front lines.

“It was the first major test of the bags under battlefield conditions, and it was an unqualified success,” Dr. Murphy said in a telephone interview from his home for this obituary in 2019. In time, he noted, the bags became a mainstay of the blood-collection and storage networks of the American Red Cross and similar organizations abroad.

(For years, researchers have said an ingredient in polyvinyl chlorides, diethylhexyl phthalate, or DEHP — used in making building materials, clothing and many health care products — poses a cancer risk to humans. Since 2008, Congress has banned DEHP in children’s products in the U.S.; the European Union has required labels; and alternative chemicals have replaced DEHP in blood bags.)

In Korea, Dr. Murphy recalled, he saw Army medics reusing needles to transfuse patients, and medical instruments were often inadequately sterilized. Alarmed at the dangers of infection, he designed a series of relatively inexpensive medical trays equipped with drugs and sterilized surgical tools that could be discarded after a single use, greatly reducing the risks of cross-contaminating patients.

In 1957, he founded the Medical Development Corporation, a Miami company that two years later became Cordis Corporation, a developer and maker of devices for diagnosing and treating heart and vascular diseases. With Dr. Murphy as chief engineer, president, chief executive and chairman, Cordis produced what he called the first synchronous cardiac pacemaker.

As the use of implanted pacemakers became more common in the 1960s and ’70s, Dr. Murphy said, he saw that the devices might be improved upon to respond not only to irregular heart rhythms — usually an abnormally slow beat — but also to signs of bleeding, tissue damage, blood-clot formation or problems with the pacemaker’s electrode leads into the heart muscle.

These complications led him and his team to develop a new generation of pacemakers that could be programmed externally. Out of this effort came the first “dual demand” pacemaker of the 1980s, with probes into two of the heart’s chambers for a fuller picture of the organ’s activity and creeping flaws.

The advanced Cordis pacemaker contained a tiny computer that could detect heart problems and, in effect, have two-way electronic conversations with a cardiologist. The cardiologist could, in turn, devise noninvasive solutions and program the computer to carry them out.

In addition, Dr. Murphy said, his team devised better ways to virtually “see” inside the vascular system. His motorized-pressure device injected, with precision, a small dose of liquid, containing iodine for color, into a selected vessel. There, the liquid showed up on an X-ray image, called an angiogram, providing a window into nooks and crannies where blockages might be lurking.

To remove blockages, Dr. Murphy and a colleague, Robert Stevens, devised sterile vascular catheters, or probes, that allowed access to obstructions in vessels. (Today’s angiographic injectors have a space-age robotic look, with tiny cameras and lights in the probes and a television screen outside to guide the doctor’s way through the tunnels.)

Under Dr. Murphy, Cordis also ventured into artificial kidneys, which cleanse the blood of waste products that accumulate normally in the body. Vital to sustaining life, the cleansing occurs when blood flows on one side of a membrane while a bath of chemicals flows on the other side. Impurities in the blood pass through tiny pores in the membrane into the bath, and are carried away.

Dr. Willem J. Kolff, a Dutch physician, made the first artificial kidney during World War II. It was a Rube Goldberg contraption: sausage casings wrapped around a wood drum rotating in a salt solution. Dr. Murphy’s device used densely packed hollow fibers of synthetic resins as filters. Despite its inefficiencies, it was widely used in wearable or implanted artificial kidneys.

Later advancements in artificial kidneys and dialysis have given thousands of patients with failing kidneys access to treatment and prolonged lives. But the devices still do not measure up to the efficient human kidney; bioengineered kidneys are still a hope of the future.

Dr. Murphy retired from Cordis in 1985 to pursue other commercial medical interests. By then, he held 17 patents, had written some 30 articles for professional journals and had received the Distinguished Service Award of the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology. He received the Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003 and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008.

William Parry Murphy Jr. was born on Nov. 11, 1923, in Boston. His father, a hematologist, shared the 1934 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for a study that showed that a diet of raw liver could ameliorate the effects of pernicious anemia. His mother, Harriett (Adams) Murphy, was the first woman to become a licensed dentist in Massachusetts.

William Jr. and his older sister, Priscilla, grew up in Brookline, the Boston suburb. As a teenager Priscilla became the youngest qualified female pilot in the country but died shortly afterward in the crash of a small plane in a snowstorm near Syracuse, N.Y., on a nighttime medical-mercy flight from Boston.

Fascinated as a boy with mechanics, William devised a gasoline-powered snow blower, whose design he sold to a company.

After graduating from Milton Academy in Massachusetts, he studied pre-medicine at Harvard, where his father taught, and graduated in 1946. He earned his medical degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1947. While studying mechanical engineering for a year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he developed a film projector to display enlarged X-ray images to medical audiences.

Dr. Murphy interned at St. Francis Hospital in Honolulu, then practiced medicine briefly at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now Brigham and Women’s Hospital) in Boston before taking up his career in biomedical engineering.

In 1943, he married Barbara Eastham, an American linguist who had been born in China. They divorced in the early 1970s. In 1973, Dr. Murphy married Beverly Patterson. She survives him, along with three daughters from his first marriage, Wendy Sorakowski and Christine and Kathleen Murphy; two grandchildren; and one great-grandson.

After retiring from Cordis, Dr. Murphy and a colleague, John Sterner, in 1986 bought Hyperion Inc., which designed, manufactured and marketed medical laboratory and diagnostic devices. In 2003, he joined the board of Bioheart, which developed stem cell therapies. He became chairman of Bioheart in 2010 and later chairman of U.S. Stem Cell, a successor company.

In 2019, a federal court empowered the Food and Drug Administration to stop U.S. Stem Cell from injecting patients with an extract made from their own belly fat. The action came after three patients suffered severe, permanent eye damage resulting from fat extracts injected into their eyes to treat macular degeneration. The company had maintained that the extract contained stem cells with healing and regenerative powers, but medical experts disputed that claim.

Dr. Murphy had by then become enthusiastic about the promise of stem cell research. In 2014, he spoke to a Miami conference about the rapidly growing and controversial field of using stem cells derived from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood to treat neurodegenerative conditions, diabetes and heart disease. “That’s a whole new world of regenerative therapy that’s going to be critical to our future,” he said."
"Brain Implants Helped 5 People Toward Recovery After Traumatic Injuries
People with chronic problems after falls and car crashes scored better on cognition tests after getting a brain implant, a new study found.

Traumatic brain injuries have left more than five million Americans permanently disabled. They have trouble focusing on even simple tasks and often have to quit jobs or drop out of school.

A study published on Monday has offered them a glimpse of hope. Five people with moderate to severe brain injuries had electrodes implanted in their heads. As the electrodes stimulated their brains, their performance on cognitive tests improved.

If the results hold up in larger clinical trials, the implants could become the first effective therapy for chronic brain injuries, the researchers said.

“This is the first evidence that you can move the dial for this problem,” said Dr. Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York who led the study.

Gina Arata, one of the volunteers who received the implant, was 22 when a car crash left her with fatigue, memory problems and uncontrollable emotions. She abandoned her plans for law school and lived with her parents in Modesto, Calif., unable to keep down a job.

In 2018, 18 years after the crash, Ms. Arata received the implant. Her life has changed profoundly, she said. “I can be a normal human being and have a conversation,” she said. “It’s kind of amazing how I’ve seen myself improve.”

Dr. Schiff and his colleagues designed the trial based on years of research on the structure of the brain. Those studies suggested that our ability to focus on tasks depends on a network of brain regions that are linked to each other by long branches of neurons. The regions send signals to each other, creating a feedback loop that keeps the whole network active.

Sudden jostling of the brain — in a car crash or a fall, for example — can break some of the long-distance connections in the network and lead people to fall into a coma, Dr. Schiff and his colleagues have hypothesized. During recovery, the network may be able to power itself back up. But if the brain is severely damaged, it may not fully rebound.

Dr. Schiff and his colleagues pinpointed a structure deep inside the brain as a crucial hub in the network. Known as the central lateral nucleus, it is a thin sheet of neurons about the size and shape of an almond shell.

The human brain has two such structures, one in each hemisphere. They seem to help the brain quiet itself at night for sleep and rev up the brain in the morning. Stimulating the neurons in these regions can wake up a sleeping rat, Dr. Schiff’s research has shown.

These studies raised the possibility that stimulating the central lateral nuclei might help people with traumatic brain injuries regain their focus and attention.

Surgeons regularly implant electrodes in patients with Parkinson’s disease. The tiny electric pulses, released by the implants hundreds of times each second, direct neighboring neurons to fire their own signals, restoring some of the brain’s functions.

In 2018, Dr. Schiff and his colleagues began recruiting volunteers, like Ms. Arata, who suffered from chronic problems for years after their accidents. Before inserting the electrodes, the researchers gave the volunteers a battery of tests to judge their ability to focus and switch tasks. In one exam, for example, the volunteers each received a sheet of paper covered in letters and numbers and had to draw a line that connected them in order as quickly as possible.

Before the surgery, the researchers scanned each volunteer’s brain to make a precise map. Dr. Jaimie Henderson, a neurosurgeon at Stanford University, guided the electrode through the brain, to the central lateral nucleus.

Dr. Henderson implanted the electrodes in six volunteers, but one of them had to drop out of the study after developing a scalp infection. Beginning a month after the surgery, the remaining five volunteers took follow-up tests. In the exam with letters and numbers, their scores jumped anywhere from 15 to 52 percent.

To get a broader understanding of the volunteers’ experiences, Dr. Joseph Fins, a medical ethicist at Weill Cornell Medicine, conducted a series of interviews with them and their family members. Most of the volunteers, like Ms. Arata, said that the implant made them more like their former selves.

The volunteer who saw the biggest improvement on cognitive tests, by contrast, had a lukewarm reaction. “I don’t think it hurt,” he said. “I just don’t know if it helped much.”

And yet that patient’s son observed significant changes, especially in his father’s self-awareness. “It’s night and day,” the son said.

Dr. Steven Laureys, a neurologist at the University of Liège in Belgium who was not involved in the study, said that the results supported the theory that attention and other forms of thinking depend on the brainwide network. “There’s enough reason to believe that it’s worth pursuing,” he said of the research.

Dr. Schiff and his colleagues are planning a much larger study of the brain implants. “We have to see how the data shakes out,” he said.

The central lateral nuclei are not the only regions that show promise as hubs in the brain network, said Dr. Alex Green, a neurosurgeon at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study.

“We don’t really know the best place to stimulate yet,” Dr. Green said. He and his colleagues are preparing a brain injury trial of their own to try electrodes in a region called the pedunculopontine nucleus.

Dr. Laureys recognized that implant surgeries would be expensive but argued that society should recognize the millions of people who suffer from traumatic brain injuries. “This is a silent epidemic,” he said."
"Homeless Advocate Takes On A.C.L.U., and It’s Personal
Jennifer Livovich started a nonprofit to give socks to the homeless population in Boulder, Colo. She lost it, and more, in a legal and policy dispute.

On the last Thursday of August, Jennifer Livovich spent the morning simmering beans and cheese sauce in her Boulder, Colo., apartment, preparing nachos. Then friends helped her load a truck with the food, along with donations she had secured — socks, toothbrushes, cellphones — to distribute at a downtown park where dozens of chronically homeless people congregate.

“Hopefully, no drama,” she said as the truck pulled away.

Ms. Livovich has become a central figure in Boulder’s efforts to help the homeless. In 2020, she created a nonprofit, Feet Forward, to serve several hundred people whom the county estimates lack permanent shelter. And she regularly consults with, and is consulted by, policymakers, housing officials and the Boulder County district attorney. In late November she wrote an op-ed in a local paper on homelessness and substance use. To these conversations, she brings an intimate expertise: For five years, from 2012 to 2017, she lived on the streets of Boulder, often inebriated, until a brush with frostbite scared her into treatment.

“She struck a chord in Boulder that I’ve not ever seen before,” said Benita Duran, a former Boulder assistant city manager.

In 2021, the American Civil Liberties Union asked Ms. Livovich and Feet Forward to join as plaintiffs in a lawsuit that would force the city to reform its homeless policies. She was told that the lawsuit was “going to change homeless lives,” she recalled. “So of course I joined.”

Lawsuits like this one are increasingly common around the country, as cities grapple with stubbornly chronic homeless populations and a vexing legal and moral question: Can a person be given a ticket for sleeping in a public area? Or, as the A.C.L.U. contends, does such a policy constitute “cruel and unusual punishment” when there are not enough shelter beds to accommodate everyone in need?

The issue in Boulder became further fraught in May, when Ms. Livovich told the A.C.L.U. that she was withdrawing from the lawsuit. In an interview, she said that she had signed on as a plaintiff without fully understanding the case being made — and that she now feels that the A.C.L.U. and its supporters ultimately do not understand the people that they are trying to help.

Ms. Livovich argued that many people who gather and often sleep around Boulder’s downtown park represent a particular subset of “the homeless.” For them, she said, the primary problem is substance abuse; cheap, potent drugs are so readily available that the “housing first” policy oversimplifies the issue. Treatment should be the first priority and, while Ms. Livovich does not favor ticketing people sleeping outside, she said that some people might need to be removed from the park for their safety, and that of the public.

“I’m not anti-housing first,” she said. “I’m not anti-housing.” But in a world of constrained resources, she added, the spending priorities need to be shifted to put greater emphasis on treatment. “There is a growing subset struggling with addiction, and I have a hard time just giving them an apartment,” she said. “That’s not going to solve their problems.”

“They need treatment,” Ms. Livovich said. “Every dollar not spent on treatment is a dollar wasted.”

The A.C.L.U., she added, “is looking at this through the lens of what is constitutional and not what is happening on the street.”

Tim Macdonald, the legal director for the A.C.L.U. of Colorado, countered that the lawsuit sought to combat what he called the “criminalization” of sleeping in public spaces without an alternative. Treatment was important, too, he said, and housing and treatment were not mutually exclusive. He declined to comment on what the A.C.L.U. said to Ms. Livovich when she joined the lawsuit, citing attorney-client privilege.

Homelessness in America
N.Y.C.’s Social Safety Net: Before nearly 100 random attacks in New York City, the mentally ill homeless people who committed them were failed by a system that kept making the same errors, our investigation found.
Anchorage’s ‘Unimaginable’ Toll: The arrival of frigid temperatures and heavy snow has contributed to several deaths of homeless people in Alaska’s largest city, where leaders are scrambling for new solutions.
A Persistent Crisis: “The Zone,” a sprawling homeless camp in downtown Phoenix, has been dismantled. But housing advocates say the move did little to resolve the issues fueling Arizona’s broader homelessness problem.
The Fight to Save Portland: The Oregon city has long grappled with homelessness. Now fentanyl has turned a perennial problem into a deadly crisis and a challenge to Portland’s progressive identity.

“Our focus is to protect the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs we still represent in this case, and continue our efforts to end the criminalization of people who are unhoused in Boulder,” Mr. Macdonald said.

He added that Ms. Livovich was important initially at the outset but her decision to withdraw doesn’t end the claims of other plaintiffs. Among them is Feet Forward, the nonprofit that Ms. Livovich founded. After she announced her withdrawal from the suit, she asked her board of directors to do the same. But it declined and the nonprofit stayed on as a plaintiff, and Ms. Livovich resigned from her own organization.

“They hijacked my nonprofit for this lawsuit,” she said of the A.C.L.U. and its allies on the Feet Forward board. “I was played.”

‘This is my park’
At the park, Ms. Livovich, 51, and her team set tables under a large tree and began distributing the tortilla chips, cheese, jalapeños and other fixings.

Wearing a T-shirt bearing the words “Be Kind,” she jovially greeted friends she knew from her street days as she handed out supplies to the hundred or so people waiting in line. A 54-year-old woman who gave her name as Julie clutched new socks and a muffin as she described how she had just been released from the hospital after being treated for pneumonia. An argument among several men rose in volume from somewhere nearby.

In its lawsuit, the A.C.L.U. contends that “homelessness in the region is generally the result of economic conditions,” and that Boulder must first provide sufficient housing before enacting “cover bans” and issuing citations for sleeping in public spaces under blankets and other forms of cover. It characterizes the ticketing as “cruel and unusual punishment.”

Boulder has countered that its police department has discretion over people sleeping in public places. In several early judgments, a district judge agreed with the city that a tent ban does not violate the state constitution but said legal arguments could continue on the question of whether people could be cited for sleeping with a blanket or other covering. A trial date is set for August.

“There is no sobriety in the park,” Ms. Livovich said, looking around. Many of the people who gather there are desperately addicted, trying to stave off withdrawal, and sometimes violent and psychotic. Ms. Livovich said that the A.C.L.U. misunderstood this subset of homeless people. In Boulder County, one-half of 1 percent of the population is homeless but accounts for 10 percent of felonies in 2018-2019, according to the county district attorney.

Ms. Livovich has argued for streamlined services, supervised treatment when necessary and even detaining people who present a risk to themselves or others. She said the lawsuit did not prioritize the well-being of people who were at risk of dying everyday. “Nobody has constitutional rights when they’re dead,” she said.

Mr. Macdonald, of the A.C.L.U., noted that some of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit had been cited for sleeping outside and that their cases “had nothing to do with drug use or illegal behavior.”

The city does not keep a daily total of its homeless population, with most data collected at the county level. In January, Boulder County reported 839 people who lacked permanent shelter; around one-half stayed in a shelter and one-quarter were in transitional housing, leaving 243 people outside. People avoid shelters for many reasons, including fear of violence or constrained freedom. Drugs play a role, too, according to a city analysis: “Either the person has self-medicated into a state in which they cannot make a reasoned decision about sheltering, or they do not want to shelter because they cannot actively use the substance while staying at the shelter.”

Kurt Firnhaber, head of Housing and Human Services for the city, said he endorsed “housing first” but that housing alone did not solve the problem for some people grappling with drug addiction. “Many individuals struggle to get through the night,” he said. And shelters were not always a refuge. One night this summer, Mr. Firnhaber said, a man at a local shelter “took a chair and started breaking all the glass in the building.”

At the park, as Ms. Livovich’s team was cleaning up, an argument that had been escalating between two men suddenly exploded when the older of the two — who was tall, with a long white beard, and wielded a six-inch knife — began chasing the other.

Ms. Livovich quickly learned the cause: There had been a fentanyl overdose in the park the night before, and the older man was chasing the dealer he thought was responsible. The police arrived and dispelled the tension. Later, Ms. Livovich said she was disappointed but not surprised by the older man’s attempt to defend the park from a perceived threat. “When I lived out here,” she said, “I used to say, ‘This is my park.’”

‘Privilege’ and desperation

Ms. Livovich grew up in Hammond, Ind., her father a financial executive and mother an administrator in a law school. She described her childhood as “privileged.” She attended Indiana University briefly but dropped out.

She married at 35, and the relationship was abusive. “Drinking was our common denominator,” Ms. Livovich said. She left the marriage at age 38, landing in South Bend, Ind., where “my drinking got crazy,” she said. In 2012, she came to Boulder.

Her life centered on feeding her alcohol addiction. “It ruled my every move,” she said. She often woke behind King Soopers, a supermarket, and then pooled her cash with other habitual drinkers and designated someone to go inside and make the purchase. “All day, every day,” she said.

People who knew her then described her as charismatic and sometimes ornery. “There are two sides of Jen — there’s sober Jen and drunk Jen,” said Brentt Van Wagner, 39, who was homeless for two dozen years until recently. When intoxicated, Ms. Livovich was “angry,” he said. “She puts her foot down a lot. Commanding — we’re going to do this, and we’re going to do it this way.” He added, “She’s a good person. She’s got a good heart.”

From 2014 to 2016, Ms. Livovich received 51 citations, spent 266 nights in jail and was “hauled to detox 72 times,” she said. Some detentions “saved my life,” she said, because she stopped drinking for a few days.

In December 2016, after a scare from frostbite, she entered sober transitional living, spent 18 months in recovery and enrolled at Colorado State University, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in human services. She was placed into housing in Boulder through a state voucher program. In October 2018, she started collecting socks to give to the homeless.

In late 2020 that effort grew into Feet Forward, whose mission expanded to provide food and other staples. It coordinated with Boulder County to provide clean needles and other harm reduction supplies, soliciting items from donors and obtaining a shuttle bus to provide mobile outreach services.

“She has a wealth of knowledge of working with people in trenches around the homeless,” said Michael Dougherty, the Boulder County district attorney, who said he has had multiple conversations with Ms. Livovich over the years.

Her manner could be direct. “She’s good at calling everybody out in the room who thinks they know better,” said Molly East, executive director of Focused Reentry, a nonprofit that helps people transition from incarceration to society. “Her lived experience is fundamental to solving things.”

A familiar story

Last spring, after Ms. Livovich withdrew from the lawsuit, she asked the board of Feet Forward to do the same. When they declined, she asked the board members to resign so that she could replace them. Only one — Ms. Duran, the former assistant city manager — did so.

“Jen kept raising the issue and saying, ‘This isn’t right. I don’t want to be involved,’” Ms. Duran said. In the end, Ms. Livovich herself resigned, to follow her own “moral compass,” she said.

Darren O’Connor, a board member, sent an email to Feet Forward volunteers. “The board was saddened to receive this resignation,” he wrote, adding, “It was important for Feet Forward to remain as a named plaintiff, as deciding to withdraw would require dismissal of the lawsuit.” Later, Mr. O’Connor said, the board learned that the lawsuit could have proceeded even if the nonprofit had dropped out.

In August, when Ms. Livovich marshaled supplies to give to the homeless, she did so under the aegis of a new nonprofit, Street Scape, that she hoped would give her and her team a platform to continue helping.

Ten days later, Ms. Livovich started drinking. Over the next week, her drinking was intermittent but consistent. She sat in a recliner in her apartment sipping 100-proof peppermint schnapps from the bottle or a tumbler, her laptop and cigarettes nearby.

This was not her first relapse, she said, but she had been largely sober for four years until the troubles started over the lawsuit. “I was so devastated,” she said. After resigning from Feet Forward, she relapsed badly, went into rehab and got sober again, briefly.

“The one thing that I had is gone,” she said, her voice slurring, eyes heavy. She had developed a mission and organization, and felt it had been taken from her. “I don’t have a place,” she said.

Friends, including local officials, checked in to remind her that she played a vital role in the community. With their support, Ms. Livovich found her way into a detox program and then started intensive work through Alcoholics Anonymous, aiming to attend 30 meetings in 30 days. Soon she was sober and “fighting for my life,” she said in a text. “Root for me.”

While she was in detox, she overheard soon-to-be-released substance users on a phone in the public area desperately calling around to find placement in long-term clinics but coming up empty. She worried for them. “The moments for recovery are fleeting,” she said. Some people may lose motivation. “And where are they going?” she said. “They’re going back to the park.”

As the weeks went by, Ms. Livovich struggled to find a Medicaid-supported therapist and a clinician to prescribe drugs for depression and anxiety, and those that might help reduce her alcohol cravings. She said there were not enough treatment options and she couldn’t find help. She made it 64 days sober, and then she relapsed again just before Thanksgiving. A few days after the holiday, she fell in her apartment, hit her head and cut the inside of her mouth, leading to an emergency room visit. Friends got her back into detox. One of them, a physician, pulled some strings and got her an appointment with a therapist and a clinician during the first week of December.

“Look at how difficult it has been for me to get treatment, and I’m relatively well connected,” Ms. Livovich said. “Imagine what it looks like for somebody who knows nobody but other guys that are getting high in the park.”"
"Why Anonymous Sperm Donation Is Over, and Why That Matters
Activists are trying to end secrecy for sperm and egg donors — a campaign that troubles some L.G.B.T.Q. families.

A few years ago, when he was in his early 30s, Tyler Levy Sniff took a home DNA test he received as a gift. The results revealed a staggering truth: His father wasn’t biologically related to him. Levy Sniff confronted his parents, who explained that after years of trying and failing to have a baby, they turned to a sperm donor. Following the standard advice at the time, they decided not to tell him for fear of driving a wedge into their family.

Levy Sniff felt as if he’d found a key to his identity that he was looking for. “It made sense of why I felt different from my family,” he said recently. He wanted more information about the person he called his “bio father” to understand his genetic heritage. “It was so important to me to know my bio father’s life story, his personality and talents and struggles,” Levy Sniff says.

But by the time he found his donor, through relatives on two genealogy websites, the man had died — another revelation that shattered him, he says. To Levy Sniff, the value of knowing where you come from is self-evident. “A lot of influence comes from your biology,” he says.

There’s plenty of support for this way of thinking. Recent findings in behavioral science show the role of genetics in shaping certain individual characteristics. Questionnaires from doctors routinely ask for generations of family medical history. And learning about your genetic ancestry can be emotionally powerful — one reason millions of people buy inexpensive at-home DNA tests and sign up for genealogy websites.

Levy Sniff has helped found the U.S. Donor Conceived Council, a group that advocates for more transparency when it comes to donor anonymity. In a sense, it’s a battle that has already been won: For earlier generations of donor-conceived children, secrecy was commonplace, but today the widespread use of DNA technology has ended any guarantee of anonymity for donors. As a result, major sperm banks in the United States are requiring donors to agree to disclose their medical histories up front and reveal their identities when a child turns 18.

Activists like Levy Sniff are pushing for a further step, however, beyond the practices of sperm banks in the private market. They want the government to ban anonymous donation. A year ago, they succeeded in making Colorado the first state to mandate that sperm and egg banks disclose donors’ identities to children who ask for the information once they turn 18. A bill introduced in the New York Senate last month would impose a similar requirement and also give parents of donor-conceived children access to a donor’s identifying information at birth.

But in the view of other donor-conceived people and L.G.B.T.Q. groups, laws that require the end of anonymity pose an unanticipated threat. Lesbian couples and single parents make up 70 percent of the people who now use sperm donors, according to a 2022 study of an assisted-reproduction clinic. Some of these families fear that disclosure laws will open the door to recognizing biological donors in some way as parents — possibly granting them parental rights and more broadly undermining the legitimacy of L.G.B.T.Q. families.

In sperm and egg donation, secrecy was the old-school choice — the one that seemed easier to many heterosexual couples as they raised their children. But now it’s nontraditional families who are most nervous about ending the practice of anonymous donation. It’s one thing for parents to choose transparency, but it’s quite another for the state to mandate it — enshrining into law, some fear, the notion that genetics are an essential part of being a family.

‘A Real Legal Risk’
It’s easy to understand why nontraditional families feel threatened. Only seven states have language in their laws that fully protects families formed through nongenetic bonds, according to a report by several L.G.B.T.Q. groups. In a recent case in Oklahoma, a lesbian couple divorced after having a donor-conceived baby. A judge ruled that the nonbiological mother lacked parental rights because she hadn’t adopted the child — and granted the sperm donor parental rights alongside the biological mother.

In many states, if you are part of a couple raising a child, and you never marry or you get a divorce, and your partner wants to sever the connection, you can be deemed a legal stranger to a child you helped raise but with whom you don’t share a genetic tie. “I worry that people may be acting in good faith but don’t understand the situations of these families,” says Douglas NeJaime, a Yale law professor who is working with L.G.B.T.Q. organizations and other academics on a joint statement of principles about access to a donor’s identifying information. “There’s a real legal risk in many places. And then there’s the idea these laws express, which is that biological ties are more important than other ties.”

Malina Simard-Halm, 27, the donor-conceived daughter of a pair of gay fathers, is a former board member of Family Equality and Colage, two groups for L.G.B.T.Q. families that are part of a coalition calling to pause the passage of more disclosure laws. Simard-Halm is sympathetic to Levy Sniff, but she doesn’t want the state to suggest that it’s vital to seek out one’s donor. Not knowing who that person is doesn’t necessarily create a void, she says. Her fathers were frank about how she and her brothers were conceived — an approach that tends to strengthen parent-child relationships, research shows — and she didn’t experience a sense of loss.

Simard-Halm remembers having to withstand the judgment of outsiders, who forced on her the assumption that nature counts more than nurture. “People would ask: ‘Who’s your mother? Where is she?’” Simard-Halm says. “Sometimes they would say flat out: ‘She’s your real parent. You need to be with her.’”

This framing was used in the past in the fight against same-sex marriage. A 2010 survey, called “My Daddy’s Name Is Donor” and funded by the Institute for American Values, a conservative group, claimed that many donor-conceived children felt hurt and isolated by their origins. The study wasn’t peer reviewed, and other research has showed that donor-conceived children generally do as well as their peers. But for years in court, opponents of same-sex marriage argued that the children of gay couples would grow up worse off, feeling fatherless or motherless.

L.G.B.T.Q. families are also concerned that some people who advocate for ending anonymity, including Levy Sniff, think children should be able to know their donor’s identity earlier than age 18 — at 16 or 14. They say this creates the possibility of conflicts between how teenagers define their families and how their parents do. Lowering the age “leaves family more legally vulnerable,” says Courtney Joslin, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. “And it impacts both the social perception of the family and maybe how kids and parents see each other.”

Birth certificates have also become a battleground. The bill introduced in the New York Senate would create a sealed birth certificate recording the identity of the donor. Birth certificates record legal parentage, which does not always accord with genetic parentage. (For example, when a woman has an affair and becomes pregnant while she’s married, her husband’s name routinely appears on the child’s birth certificate.)

“Birth certificates have not been a system of biologically-based birth registration,” NeJaime says. “The idea that the state should use birth certificates to record genetic rather than legal parentage has been an argument of the right.”

‘Family-Lite’
For the L.G.B.T.Q. groups, the solution isn’t a return to secrecy but rather equal legal protection for families created through interpersonal bonds rather than genetic ones. They want states to pass the 2017 version of a model bill, the Uniform Parentage Act, which makes clear that a person who uses sperm or egg donation with the intent to be a parent is a parent, regardless of factors including genetic ties and marital status. The act also specifies that sperm and egg donors have no parental rights or responsibilities. (The provision makes explicit a distinction between donation and adoption, where birth parents have rights they choose to relinquish.) The L.G.B.T.Q. coalition supported Colorado’s disclosure law last year because the state had in place the legal protections they sought. That approach balances the importance of genetic ties with the security that equal status brings.

Apart from the concerns about disclosure laws, some L.G.B.T.Q. parents and their children welcome the expanded sense of family that transparency can bring. If everyone involved consents, sperm banks can facilitate matches among “diblings” — the other offspring with whom a child shares a donor’s genes. And online, the Donor Sibling Registry matches almost 1,700 people a year.

Estee Simmons, the 11-year-old daughter of a lesbian mother in Massachusetts, met one of her diblings for the first time a few years ago. The girls were astonished by how alike their hands looked. They grew close by discovering a shared sense of personal style and building social bonds over text messages and periodic visits. “It’s like having cousins, but more real,” Estee says. Her mother, who has her own friendship with the mother of Estee’s dibling, calls the relationships “family-lite.”

Estee has nine diblings in all. Eight of them are in touch. They’ve decided together to wait until they’re all 18 to learn their donor’s identity and ask to meet him.

For Estee, that will mean extra years of delay. That’s OK with her. She’s curious about her donor — but “he’s not that important,” she says."
"Fate of Billions for Opioid Victims From Sacklers Rests With Supreme Court
The court will decide whether Purdue’s owners can gain permanent immunity from future opioid lawsuits in exchange for payments up to $6 billion.

In 2014, when the first opioid lawsuits were filed against Purdue Pharma, Tiffinee Scott’s daughter was still years away from her fatal overdose from addictive prescription painkillers, including Purdue’s OxyContin, which she was taking to manage sickle cell pain.

That year, Dede Yoder’s teenage son was struggling with an addiction that began with an OxyContin prescription for a sports injury. He would die from an overdose in 2017, after attempting rehab eight times.

It would be years before Gary Carter’s son, who had been filching his grandparents’ OxyContin, would die from an overdose of fentanyl, an illicit opioid that many people who became addicted to prescription painkillers eventually turned to over the past decade.

The three families and others who have ended up suing Purdue shared their stories in letters to the Supreme Court, which will hear oral argument Monday on the remaining sticking point in the yearslong effort to settle litigation that has ballooned into nearly 3,000 cases. A multi-billion-dollar agreement is at stake.

A ruling upholding the disputed provision would finally start the flow of payments from the company and its owners — members of the billionaire Sackler family — to cities, states, tribes and individuals to help them cope with the costs of the ongoing opioid crisis. It would also allow Purdue to emerge from bankruptcy restructuring as a public benefit company.

A ruling against the measure could blow up the painstakingly negotiated settlement, leaving the fate of the company and the urgently sought payments up in the air.

The court will consider the legality of a condition demanded by the Sacklers and approved by a bankruptcy judge: In exchange for paying up to $6 billion, the Sacklers insist on being shielded from civil lawsuits that anyone else might want to bring against them involving Purdue and opioids.

That liability shield is standard for businesses that file for bankruptcy, as Purdue has done. But the Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy. Still, they argue that because the Purdue settlement relies on their personal contributions, Purdue’s liability protection should also extend to them.

The situation has created an agonizing irony for many who have lost loved ones to opioids. Desperate for funds to pay off their debts and address the addiction crisis, many support giving the Sacklers the sweeping legal pass.

“NO ONE wants to see the Sacklers pay the full price more than me,” Cheryl Juaire, who organized grieving parents, wrote to the court. “I lost TWO SONS as a result of their actions. But the only thing that will make my personal tragedy worse is to know that others will suffer the way I do every day.”

An overwhelming majority of claimants reached that conclusion more than two years ago, voting in favor of the settlement plan, including liability immunity for the Sacklers. They said they feared that protracted litigation would devour money that they have long needed.

But an arm of the Justice Department that monitors bankruptcy proceedings objected, along with a handful of other parties, arguing that precluding people from having their day in court was both unconstitutional and outside the power of a bankruptcy court.

Last summer, after a federal appeals court upheld the Sackler shields, the Justice Department division, the U.S. Trustee Program, petitioned the Supreme Court to take up the matter.

The speed with which the court scheduled the case may reflect its awareness of the opioid problem. But legal experts said its ruling would be unlikely to dwell on the public health crisis. The court, they said, will focus narrowly on the liability shield, an increasingly popular, though contentious, bankruptcy tactic.

“I’m sure, though, that even if the opioid crisis doesn’t show up anywhere in the opinion, the court has to be bearing in mind that cities, states and individuals have been desperately waiting for these funds. They need to know the answer to this question so they can figure out what to do next,” said Adam Zimmerman, who teaches mass tort law at the University of Southern California’s Gould School of Law.

Though numerous pharmaceutical companies have been sued for their roles in the opioid epidemic, the Sacklers and Purdue loom large in the story of the complex, decades-old crisis. Their signature drug, OxyContin, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in late 1995, became a game changer in a new market hungry for prescription painkillers. To the medical establishment that was then beginning to recognize pain as a “fifth vital sign,” long-acting OxyContin looked like a wondrous medication.

Purdue became known for lavish sales conferences, at which pain medicine physicians, trained and hired by the company, would falsely claim that the risk of addiction to OxyContin was extremely low. By 2007, Purdue and three of its top executives had paid fines of $634.5 million and pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges for misleading regulators, doctors and patients about the drug’s potential for abuse.

The steep fines did little to deter Purdue from continuing to aggressively market OxyContin.

Eventually, attention became focused on the Sacklers themselves, some of whom served as Purdue board members and made large charitable donations to medical schools and museums. In exchange, the institutions renamed buildings after the Sacklers. But as the family saga became featured in books, television series and documentaries and their notoriety grew, most institutions stripped the Sackler name from their properties and dissociated themselves from Purdue’s owners.

The size of the Sacklers’ fortune from OxyContin has long been a mystery. An independent audit commissioned by Purdue for the bankruptcy court found that the Sacklers withdrew about $10.5 billion from Purdue between 2008 and 2017, of which they paid more than 40 percent in taxes. The $6 billion settlement offer, the Sacklers say, represents most of the profit from the drug during that period.

As lawsuits against Purdue and the Sacklers rapidly accrued, in 2019 Purdue sought restructuring in bankruptcy court, a move that automatically suspended all lawsuits against the company. The tactic was the first step on the path leading toward the Supreme Court.

Most other companies that have been sued over their role in the opioid crisis — drug manufacturers, distributors and retailers — have reached settlements and are starting to make payments. But the opioid tragedy has not receded. Though production of prescription painkillers slowed, cheap heroin and then fentanyl rushed in to fuel an ever-growing demand. During a 12-month period ending in June, overdose fatalities from opioids and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, were predicted to surpass 111,000, according to provisional federal data.

Whether the billions of dollars in the Purdue settlement and others will have a meaningful impact on addiction and overdose fatality rates remains to be seen. In January 2018, Dan A. Polster, a federal judge in Cleveland assigned to oversee nationwide opioid settlements, asked whether a court was, in fact, the proper place to grapple with a public health crisis that had passed through the hands of federal and state regulators, physicians, hospitals and insurers as well as the pharmaceutical industry.

“The federal court is probably the least likely branch of government to try and tackle this, but candidly, the other branches of government, federal and state, have punted,” he said.

Now, nearly six years after his remarks, with the Supreme Court about to wade in, the national opioid litigation may be edging toward conclusion. But many health and legal experts believe it will not resolve the addiction crisis that it was intended to address.

“It’s easy for people to think, ‘Hey, we’ll go to court, and we’ll solve the problem,’ but that also assumes that the way you solve a public health crisis is just by handing out money,” said Abbe R. Gluck, a Yale Law School professor and an author of a forthcoming article on unorthodox uses of bankruptcy.

Congress and oversight agencies need to step up, Ms. Gluck said. “When it comes to opioids,” she added, “there’s a lot more that has to happen that litigation can’t touch.”"
"‘Medical Freedom’ Activists Take Aim at New Target: Childhood Vaccine Mandates
Mississippi has long had high childhood immunization rates, but a federal judge has ordered the state to allow parents to opt out on religious grounds.

For more than 40 years, Mississippi had one of the strictest school vaccination requirements in the nation, and its high childhood immunization rates have been a source of pride. But in July, the state began excusing children from vaccination if their parents cited religious objections, after a federal judge sided with a “medical freedom” group.

Today, 2,100 Mississippi schoolchildren are officially exempt from vaccination on religious grounds. Five hundred more are exempt because their health precludes vaccination. Dr. Daniel P. Edney, the state health officer, warns that if the total number of exemptions climbs above 3,000, Mississippi will once again face the risk of deadly diseases that are now just a memory.

“For the last 40 years, our main goal has been to protect those children at highest risk of measles, mumps, rubella, polio,” Dr. Edney said in an interview, “and that’s those children that have chronic illnesses that make them more vulnerable.” He called the ruling “a very bitter pill for me to swallow.”

Mississippi is not an isolated case. Buoyed by their success at overturning coronavirus mandates, medical and religious freedom groups are taking aim at a new target: childhood school vaccine mandates, long considered the foundation of the nation’s defense against infectious disease.

Until the Mississippi ruling, the state was one of only six that refused to excuse students from vaccination for religious or philosophical reasons. Similar legal challenges have been filed in the five remaining states: California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia. The ultimate goal, according to advocates behind the lawsuits, is to undo vaccine mandates entirely, by getting the issue before a Supreme Court that is increasingly sympathetic to religious freedom arguments.

No major religions, including Roman Catholicism, which strongly opposes abortion, have objected to vaccination. But the plaintiffs in these cases say their religious objections stem in part from the use of fetal tissue in vaccine development. A few childhood vaccines, including those that protect against chickenpox and rubella, were developed with cells obtained from aborted fetuses in the early 1960s. Those cells continue to grow in laboratories today.

The legal push comes as childhood vaccine exemptions have reached a new high in the United States, according to a report released last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three percent of children who entered kindergarten last year received an exemption, the C.D.C. said, up from 1.6 percent in the 2011-12 school year.

Idaho had the highest rate of exemptions, at 12.1 percent, while West Virginia had the lowest, at less than one-tenth of 1 percent. Mississippi’s rate was nearly as low, at two-tenths of 1 percent. At the time, Mississippi allowed exemptions for medical reasons, as all states do, but it did not yet allow parents to opt out on religious grounds.

A broad majority of Americans continue to believe in the value of childhood vaccines. But in a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March, 28 percent of respondents said that parents should be able to choose not to vaccinate their children, up 12 percentage points from four years ago.

A New Target: Buoyed by their success at overturning coronavirus mandates, “medical freedom” groups are now taking aim at childhood school vaccine mandates.

In California, a group of parents backed by Advocates for Faith & Freedom, a nonprofit group devoted to religious liberty, filed suit in federal court in October seeking to restore the state’s “philosophical” exemption, which was eliminated after a measles outbreak in 2015. A federal judge recently allowed a similar case to go forward in Maine, which ended its religious exemption in 2021.

Connecticut, which also did away with its religious exemption in 2021, has faced legal challenges backed by We the Patriots USA, a group based in Idaho. In August, a divided federal appeals court rejected a constitutional challenge to the state law, and on Friday, a federal judge dismissed a second lawsuit. Brian Festa, a founder of We the Patriots, said in an interview that his group would ask the Supreme Court to take up the question.

“We’re looking for a broader ruling from the high court that says all children in the United States should be allowed exemptions to childhood vaccinations,” Mr. Festa said, adding that allowing exemptions for medical but not religious reasons was “a major constitutional problem.”

Preventing Deaths
Public health experts regard vaccination as a singular triumph. The World Health Organization says up to five million deaths worldwide are prevented each year by vaccines for diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles. In the United States, measles alone once killed 400 to 500 people each year and whooping cough deaths numbered in the thousands, while polio left more than 15,000 paralyzed, according to the C.D.C.

If vaccination rates dip much below 95 percent, public health experts warn, those diseases will become more than just a memory.

“It’s a dangerous game we’re playing,” said Dr. Paul A. Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “If we eliminate school vaccine mandates, measles will be the first vaccine-preventable disease to come back, and it will come roaring back. Why would we want to put children in harm’s way again?”

The Mississippi case offers a window into the political forces shaping these trends. The plaintiffs in the case included members of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights, a group founded in 2012 by MaryJo Perry, who said in an interview that her path into advocacy began after her youngest son, now 20, experienced seizures following routine vaccination.

Seizures are a rare occurrence after vaccination. A large-scale study of more than 265,000 children identified 383 who had vaccine-related seizures, or less than two-tenths of 1 percent. Nearly all children who have post-vaccination seizures recover completely.

Ms. Perry said that while her son had not had ongoing issues, the experience was terrifying. She said her son’s pediatrician repeatedly requested a medical exemption from the state health department but was refused. (Dr. Edney said that Mississippi’s current practice was to grant a medical exemption if a doctor requested one.)

“I felt like it was a nightmare, like I was being terrorized by my own government,” Ms. Perry said.

Years of Activism
Mississippi had a religious exemption until the state’s Supreme Court struck it down in 1979, reasoning that protecting Mississippi schoolchildren “against the horrors of crippling and death” from polio and other infectious diseases superseded religious claims. The state has had high childhood vaccination rates as a result.

“For many, many years, it was one of the few things that Mississippi has done well,” said Dr. Anita S. Henderson, a pediatrician in Hattiesburg and a past president of the state’s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “About 99 percent of our kindergartners have been fully vaccinated, and Mississippi has not seen a case of measles in over 30 years.”

Ms. Perry and members of her group tried for years to change the law. They marched with signs and empty strollers around the State Capitol and held lobbying days to push Mississippi’s Republican-controlled Legislature to add a “personal belief” exemption to state law. But the legislation never passed.

In 2016, Ms. Perry met Del Bigtree, a former television producer who had partnered on a documentary with Andrew Wakefield, the British doctor behind the discredited theory that vaccines are linked to autism. Their film, “Vaxxed,” took aim at the drug industry and was a hit with Ms. Perry’s group. Mr. Bigtree later traveled to Mississippi to testify on behalf of legislation that the organization was supporting to expand vaccine exemptions.

In an interview, Mr. Bigtree said the success of the film prompted him to found the Informed Consent Action Network. The group, based in Texas and known by the acronym ICAN, says its mission is to give people “the authority over your health choices and those of your children” and to put an end to “medical coercion.” It funded the Mississippi lawsuit, and tax filings show it spends millions of dollars on legal work.

Mr. Bigtree says his work is nonpartisan. But on Jan. 6, 2021, he addressed a “medical freedom” rally not far from the pro-Trump crowd that stormed the U.S. Capitol.

“I would stand on the stage at the Democratic National Convention if they would allow me,” he said in the interview, adding: “I don’t want mandates. It’s a free country. Everybody should be able to make whatever choice they want.”

But public health experts say that the purpose of vaccination is to protect entire communities and that making immunization a personal choice puts vulnerable people, including those who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons, at risk. Last year, a measles outbreak in Ohio infected 85 children, nearly all of them unvaccinated. No one died, but 36 children were hospitalized.

States have long had the legal authority to require vaccination as a condition of school enrollment. As far back as 1905, the Supreme Court ruled in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that a state had the right to “protect itself against an epidemic” by requiring citizens to be vaccinated against smallpox or pay a fine.

But the coronavirus pandemic, and in particular the arrival of Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court, brought a “dramatic shift” in public health jurisprudence — especially in cases involving religious liberty, said Wendy E. Parmet, an expert in public health law at Northeastern University.

A Legal Victory
The Mississippi case was filed last year, and Dr. Edney, the state health officer, was one of the defendants. Ms. Perry was not a plaintiff; her children are grown. But she connected some of her members with Aaron Siri, a New York lawyer who handles much of ICAN’s legal work.

During a hearing in April in Federal District Court in Gulfport, Paul Perkins, a Baptist pastor, testified that the state’s vaccination requirement prevented him from enrolling his own daughter in the Christian academy that he runs. Jeana Stanley, a doctor of physical therapy, and Brandi Renfroe, a court reporter, testified that even though they and their husbands worked in Mississippi and considered that state home, they had moved just across the border to Alabama so their unvaccinated children could attend school.

“I put my trust in God for healing,” Dr. Stanley wrote in an affidavit, adding that she and her children avoided “physicians, medications (both over the counter and prescription) and vaccines.”

The case put Dr. Edney and the Mississippi State Board of Health at odds with the state attorney general, Lynn Fitch, a Republican who argued that an existing religious freedom law required the state to offer religious exemptions.

At the hearing in April, the judge, Halil Suleyman Ozerden, an appointee of President George W. Bush, ordered the state to begin accepting requests for religious exemptions, setting a mid-July deadline for Dr. Edney to set up a process for offering them.

“Freedom wins again,” Mr. Siri wrote on Twitter.

The judge made his ruling final in August, finding that Mississippi’s vaccination requirement had violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs, who he said had “sincerely held religious beliefs about vaccination.” Dr. Edney said he decided not to appeal. He said he feared that the case would go to the Supreme Court and that the state’s vaccination requirement would be struck down entirely.

Instead, he said, the state is working to ensure that parents seeking exemptions have “deeply held” beliefs, including by requiring them to watch an educational video about “the millions of lives that have been saved and continue to be saved” by vaccination.

Mr. Bigtree hailed the suit as a “landmark, historic case.” In the wake of its victory, his group trumpeted its support for similar legal challenges in other states.

Ms. Perry said Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights was working to elect candidates who are “pro-medical freedom.” She said she saw the court ruling as the culmination of a decade of her hard work, coupled with a new political climate.

“We’ve had many parents for years wanting to sue, and it was just not the right time,” she said. “Covid kind of set the stage in the judiciary for it to happen.”"
"What to Know About Home Care Services
Finding an aide to help an older person stay at home safely takes work. Here’s a guide.

Most older Americans want to live at home as long as they can, but finding and affording the help they need often isn’t easy. There are severe shortages of home health aides in many parts of the country. Hiring them is costly. And most middle-class people will have to pay for home care themselves if they will need it for the long haul. Here’s a guide to locating home care for an older person.

What kind of home care do you need?
After a fall or surgery, some older people will need short-term care at home from a nurse or therapist to help them recover. Medicare, the federal insurance program for those 65 and over, typically pays for this kind of home health care. A nurse can make sure a wound is healing properly, for example, while a physical therapist can help a person get back on their feet after a knee replacement.

But millions of older Americans need assistance over months or years to stay in their homes safely instead of moving to an assisted-living facility or nursing home. They may require help getting out of bed, taking a shower or going to the bathroom; getting to the doctor; shopping for groceries or making meals. They need a home health aide or personal care assistant, who may not have much, if any, medical training.

How do I find help?
A wide range of services are available, whether it’s light housekeeping or hiring a private-duty nurse. Monica Moreno, senior director of care and support at the Alzheimer’s Association, suggests that you start by making a simple list of the kind of help you or your loved one needs and the number of hours each day or week required.

To identify agencies and services available in your area, Ms. Moreno recommends looking through a database of community resources provided jointly by the association and AARP, the nonprofit group representing older Americans, that is searchable by location. A list of agencies and a brief description of what they provide can be found under the category of home care. AARP also has a guide to finding a home health aide.

Should I use an agency?
While Medicare certifies and gives star ratings to home health agencies, the businesses that provide home care services are not subject to federal oversight or required to be licensed in every state. But a good agency will run background checks on its workers and give them training and support. If an aide calls in sick or quits, the agency can find a replacement. Some businesses also bond and insure their caregivers.

To choose an agency, Jennifer Battista, the chief operating officer for the Home Care Association of America, suggests inviting several of them to your home to conduct an assessment. Ask them how they vet their employees, whether they run criminal background checks, and whether their employees are required to know how to perform CPR or provide first aid. Be sure to ask for references for individual aides and talk to families who have employed them before.

Once you pick an agency, you may want to try a few caregivers before finding the right one. The more information you share about your loved ones’ needs, the better the agency will be able to find an aide who’s a good fit. “It’s a lot like matchmaking,” Ms. Battista said.

What about finding someone through word of mouth?
Many families have success finding a caregiver by asking people they trust for recommendations, said Nicole Jorwic, a lawyer who is the chief of advocacy and campaigns for Caring Across Generations, an advocacy organization. “Cast a wide net, post on private social media and ask family and friends,” she said, noting that she found caregivers for her grandparents by asking people in her community.

Churches and other religious institutions, local charities and community organizations may also have suggestions. A primary care doctor or local medical practice may have experience with specific home care agencies or know of individual caregivers. If you decide to hire someone privately, you should be sure to do a thorough background check and talk to families who have employed that person before. Family Caregiver Alliance, a California nonprofit group, provides a guide.

Will Medicare cover the cost of an aide?
Many home agencies erroneously say they can’t send a home aide and will tell a doctor’s office or patient that Medicare won’t pay for one. “This is a longstanding problem,” said Judith A. Stein, the executive director for the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit legal group.

While it’s true that Medicare doesn’t pay for long-term care, it may pay for an aide as part of a patient’s care plan if that person also qualifies for a home nurse or therapist for a time. Agencies often refuse to provide someone because Medicare pays a lump sum per patient, meaning the agency isn’t paid more for sending an aide in addition to the nurse or therapist. Talk to the doctor about whether an aide is necessary so one can be specified in the care plan presented to the agency.

Medicare patients are getting fewer visits from an aide now than they did some 25 years ago, and the center is now appealing a judge’s dismissal of a lawsuit claiming that Medicare, under the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, discouraged the use of aides for thousands of people. The judge did acknowledge that many people were not getting care.

Will other insurance pay for an aide?
Under Medicaid, the state-federal program for the poor that provides long-term care, the cost of an aide is often covered as an alternative to a nursing home. But the shortage of workers can make it difficult to find one even if you qualify. Families complain of frequent no-shows, and the low wages paid under the program mean that agencies often have high turnover among workers.

Some private Medicare Advantage plans offer home care as a supplemental benefit, and it’s possible that some help will be covered under a long-term care insurance policy. If you or your loved one is a veteran, it’s worth checking with Veterans Affairs to see if it will pay for home care.

How much will an aide cost?
If you decide to pay privately, the hourly rates charged by agencies vary widely, and some agencies may not be able to fill a position for just a few hours a week. In San Jose, Calif., half of the agencies charged more than $37 an hour for a home health aide in 2021, according to Genworth, the long-term care insurer. Across the country, agencies are charging roughly $27 an hour with a little more than half of that going to pay their workers.

There are no good estimates for how much people working for themselves may charge. You could save some money because there is no middleman taking a cut, but some independent caregivers charge roughly the same as an agency.

How do I report a problem?
If the agency you’re using is licensed by your state, you can check with the government office overseeing it if you run into a problem. You can also file a complaint with various state agencies, including the state health department.

Where else can I get help?
State or local government agencies that focus on aging or nonprofit groups can provide information. You can also try the eldercare locator. The Alzheimer’s Association also has some advice for finding caregivers, and it offers a 24-hour help line, 1-800-272-3900.

What about respite care?
Family caregivers should also think about taking advantage of respite care to give themselves a break from time to time. Depending on the circumstances, insurance may cover the cost, and there are local government and community groups that will also pay for an aide for a brief period. Churches and other organizations may also provide respite care."
"Scientists in Discredited Alcohol Study Will Not Advise U.S. on Drinking Guidelines
Two researchers with ties to beer and liquor companies had been named to a panel that will review the health evidence on alcohol consumption. But after a New York Times story was published, the panel’s organizers decided to drop them.

Five years ago, the National Institutes of Health abruptly pulled the plug on an ambitious study about the health effects of moderate drinking. The reason: The trial’s principal scientist and officials from the federal agency’s own alcohol division had solicited $60 million for the research from alcohol manufacturers, a conflict of interest and a violation of federal policy.

Recently, that scientist and another colleague from the aborted study with alcohol industry ties were named to a committee preparing a report on alcohol and health that will be used to update the federal government’s guidelines on alcohol consumption.

The appointments of the two men, Dr. Kenneth Mukamal and Dr. Eric Rimm, both of Harvard, have not been finalized yet, Megan Lowry, a spokeswoman for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, whose food and nutrition board formed the committee, said this week in response to an inquiry from The New York Times. Members of the public can submit comments on the tentative appointments through Wednesday, Dec. 6.

Less than an hour after this article was published, Ms. Lowry emailed to say the academies had decided not to include Dr. Mukamal and Dr. Rimm on the panel.

“After considering public comments the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have received on provisional appointees to a committee that will review the evidence of the effects of alcohol on health, Eric B. Rimm and Kenneth J. Mukamal are no longer being considered for service on the committee,” Ms. Lowry wrote.

Dr. Rimm, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has said in various financial disclosures that he has accepted money from the alcohol industry, had been nominated to chair the committee.

Many public health researchers were outraged at the prospect of the men influencing a process that will result in official guidance on drinking.

“It’s like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a public health researcher and visiting professor at Tufts University School of Medicine.

The N.I.H, the nation’s top medical research agency, had halted the $100 million study, which was to be a decade-long international clinical trial of moderate drinking, after learning that officials from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism had lobbied beer and liquor companies to fund the trial and that Dr. Mukamal had gone to industry meetings where he described the proposed trial and indicated that the results would support moderate drinking. Dr. Mukamal denied any wrongdoing at the time and said he had never received funding from the industry.

An internal N.I.H. investigation into the affair suggested the trial had been designed in a way that biased the study in favor of showing a beneficial effect from moderate drinking.

Dr. Rimm has long voiced the view that moderate drinking protects against heart disease. Just last month, he said on a science and nutrition  podcast that people could cut their risk of heart disease by changing their behaviors and eating a healthy diet that includes “a little bit of alcohol.”

Asked to comment, Dr. Rimm said it was premature because the appointments were not final. Dr. Mukamal did not respond to a request for comment.

The new panel will review evidence about the relationship between drinking and a range of health issues, including obesity, cancer, heart disease, cognitive health and all-cause mortality. It will also examine the effects of drinking while breastfeeding, including the impact on postpartum weight loss; milk composition and quantity; and infant development.

Although moderate drinking — particularly of wine, especially red wine — has long enjoyed something of a health halo, more rigorous research in recent years and concerns about bias in industry-funded research have raised doubts about the professed benefits.

Cancer doctors say that even light drinking can slightly raise a woman’s risk of breast cancer, and also increase risk for a common type of esophageal cancer, while heavy drinkers face much higher risks of mouth and throat cancer, cancer of the voice box, liver cancer and, to a lesser extent, colorectal cancers.

In 2020, when the U.S. dietary guidelines were last updated, the government rejected the advice of its scientific advisers to set lower targets for alcohol consumption. Citing a growing body of evidence that consuming higher amounts of alcohol is linked to an increased risk of death, the scientists wanted the guidelines to recommend daily alcohol consumption of no more than one drink a day for both men and women, instead of the current two drinks a day for men and one a day for women.

Canadian health officials radically overhauled their guidelines for alcohol consumption earlier this year, declaring that no amount of alcohol consumption is healthy and recommending that people reduce drinking as much as possible. The new guidelines were a major shift from previous ones, which recommended that women consume no more than 10 drinks per week and that men limit themselves to 15.

The new panel reviewing the evidence for the U.S. government will operate under the aegis of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, a nongovernmental body that was allocated $1.3 million by Congress to do the work.

Eventually, the Department of Health and Human Services will oversee the updating of the federal nutritional guidelines for both food and alcohol. But the legislation that allocated the funds says that the secretary of agriculture is responsible for ensuring that “the process is fully transparent and includes a balanced representation of individuals who are unbiased and free from conflicts of interest.”

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is a part of H.H.S., will consider the committee’s report when it makes its recommendations about how much alcohol American adults should drink, in the next edition of the dietary guidelines, according to Joellen Leavelle, a spokeswoman for the H.H.S. division of health promotion and communication.

"U.S. Health Officials Push Back on Idea of New Virus in China
A surge of children has been hospitalized in China for respiratory illnesses, but international health authorities said the cause was common viruses and bacteria.

A small group of Republican senators on Friday called on President Biden to ban travel from China to protect against an outbreak of respiratory illnesses in children there, even as scientists and global and American health officials said there were no signs of a threatening new pathogen.

Instead, those experts said, the evidence so far pointed to a surge of age-old infectious agents such as influenza, driven by the colder weather and China’s emergence from stringent Covid lockdowns. The World Health Organization said last week that China had shared data about its outbreak, including laboratory results from infected children, that did not show any unusual pathogens.

Dr. Mandy Cohen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, echoed that assessment on Friday. She said American officials had also been in touch with Chinese authorities, academic experts and health workers.

“What we have all been able to ascertain is that there is no novel pathogen,” she said. “This is all related to upticks of known viruses and bacteria in their pediatric population.”

What is sickening children in China?
The W.H.O. said that the data China shared last week showed a rise in the number of children hospitalized with cold and flu viruses and respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V., since October. The agency also said infections with mycoplasma pneumoniae, a bacterium that generally causes mild illness, had been climbing since May.

Those illnesses, together with Covid, accounted for a surge of respiratory disease in children, said Chinese health officials, who announced the rise in cases at a news conference in mid-November. Parents there have described waits of eight hours or more at children’s hospitals.

More on Covid-19
N95 Companies: Project N95 and Mask-C, two face mask providers, said they were closing, a sign of the slow and steady decline of what was once a much-sought-after item.
Omicron: In the two years since its emergence, the dominant variant of the coronavirus has proved to be not only staggeringly infectious, but an evolutionary marvel, challenging many assumptions virologists had before the pandemic.
Long Covid: As more young Americans report serious cognitive problems, scientists suggest that the increase captures the effects of long Covid, most likely in addition to other effects of the pandemic, including psychological distress.
Stroke Risk: The Covid vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may be linked to a slight increase in the risk of stroke when administered along with a high-dose flu vaccine that is usually given to older people, according to a new analysis by the F.D.A.

Some of the same pathogens are already on the rise in the United States as winter takes hold, experts said, obviating the threat of imported cases from China.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which sickens millions of Americans every year, tends to cause an increase in infections every three to seven years for reasons that are not well understood.

“There isn’t a place in the world that doesn’t have mycoplasma, that doesn’t have rhinovirus and influenza virus,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “They are the normal respiratory viruses and germs that we encounter as we normally grow up.”

Why the surge?
As countries have lifted Covid lockdowns in recent years, they have tended to experience surges of routine respiratory illnesses in children.

That was true last year in the United States, where an earlier-than-expected wintertime “tripledemic” of Covid, flu and R.S.V. cases strained hospitals. Before that, Australia, too, suffered an especially bad flu season. Even this year’s respiratory illness season in the United States started a bit earlier than usual, Dr. Schaffner said.

Scientists attribute those outbreaks to children’s immune systems being behind schedule after years of lost learning about how to fight off everyday viruses during Covid lockdowns. Kept from schools and day care centers, they were sheltered from pathogens that would otherwise have infected them sooner.

“Then when they all got together,” Dr. Schaffner said, “whoo, the viruses had a field day.”

Children in China were especially vulnerable because of the length and severity of lockdowns there, scientists said, potentially creating a more substantial post-lockdown boom in routine infections.

Scientists have also reported elevated rates of resistance to mycoplasma pneumoniae antibiotics in China, a problem that could sharpen the severity of outbreaks and that W.H.O. officials said they were trying to learn more about.

Is the United States having any unusual outbreaks?
A county in Ohio this week reported “an extremely high number of pediatric pneumonia cases,” including some caused by cold viruses or mycoplasma pneumoniae. But health officials there said they did not believe that a new respiratory disease was responsible or that there was any link with outbreaks abroad.

Dr. Cohen, the C.D.C. director, said that more than 80 percent of emergency rooms across the country make daily reports to health officials. In those reports, she said, “we are not seeing anything that is atypical in terms of pneumonia-related emergency department visits.”

Ohio has not reported any deaths as part of its pediatric outbreak, Dr. Cohen said, and most children are receiving treatment and recovering at home.

“Hospital capacity is fine, children are recovering at home — these are pathogens that are known to us,” Dr. Cohen said.

What can Americans do?
“Don’t fret about what’s happening in China,” Dr. Schaffner said. But, he said, “This afternoon, get yourself vaccinated.”

Even if the outbreaks in China do not appear to pose a global threat, scientists said, familiar respiratory illnesses were spreading widely enough in the United States that those eligible should get vaccinated against Covid, the flu and R.S.V.

By mid-November, fewer than four in 10 adults in the United States had received flu vaccines. Uptake of the updated Covid vaccines, too, has been sluggish.

Meanwhile, American and global health officials said they would keep monitoring cases in China, which has faced intense scrutiny after covering up early cases of both the SARS virus in 2003 and Covid.

While China has been more forthcoming about its latest outbreaks than about early Covid cases, Dr. Schaffner said, it could provide more public data about the age of those infected, the cities where illnesses were spreading and the causes of reported cases of severe pneumonia.

Travel bans, though, would not help, Dr. Schaffner said. The W.H.O. has also said travel restrictions were not warranted."
"Abraham Bergman, Doctor Who Sought Answers on SIDS, Dies at 91
He worked for the passage of major public health legislation; most notably, he helped secure millions in federal dollars for research into sudden infant death syndrome.

Dr. Abraham B. Bergman, a pediatrician who was instrumental in passing a federal law to combat sudden infant death syndrome, a once misunderstood loss that caused not just parental heartbreak but guilt and blame, and who put his stamp on other enduring public health laws, died on Nov. 10 in Seattle. He was 91.

The cause of his death, on a family member’s boat, was amyloid heart disease, his son Ben said.

In the 1960s and early ’70s, Dr. Bergman was president of the National Foundation for Sudden Infant Death, a grass-roots group that supported parents who had lost children to what was once commonly called crib death. Although SIDS, as the syndrome became known, was the leading killer of infants less than a year old, its cause was unknown. Parents often blamed themselves, marriages broke up and, in some cases, the authorities investigated for child abuse.

“What we do to those parents is crime,” Dr. Bergman told The New York Times in 1972. “The police investigate, there’s a coroner’s inquest, and often the family doctor abandons the parents.”

Dr. Bergman’s group sought to destigmatize SIDS, support grieving parents and raise money for research. Its efforts led to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Act of 1974, which appropriated millions of dollars for research.

Dr. Bergman, who called his decades-long advocacy for improving childhood health “political medicine,” was a passionate witness in hearings on Capitol Hill on a variety of issues. He offered heart-wrenching anecdotes and chastised lawmakers for their inaction. But he also worked behind the scenes as a de facto lobbyist to move bills. Cultivating ties to two influential U.S. senators from Washington State, Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson, he was unusually successful as a private citizen who influenced legislation.

“Magnuson really trusted Abe, who had his ear and motivated him to do a lot,” said Eric Redman, a former legislative aide to Mr. Magnuson.

In 1967, Dr. Bergman jolted Mr. Magnuson by taking him to the burn unit of a Seattle children’s hospital and showing him young patients who had been badly injured when their clothes caught fire. Before a Senate subcommittee that Mr. Magnuson led, Dr. Bergman held up a flannel nightgown of the kind that a 2-year-old girl has been wearing when it ignited from a space heater, burning her over 85 percent of her body.

“You senators are in a position to save far more lives than physicians,” he said.

In response, Congress toughened and broadened the Flammable Fabrics Act to require more flame-resistant clothing.

In 1970, Dr. Bergman proposed to Mr. Magnuson the idea for the National Health Service Corps, a federal program to encourage doctors, dentists and nurses to work for a time in poor communities. Dr. Bergman enlisted medical students to lobby key members of Congress in their home districts. He personally went to West Virginia to put pressure on Representative Harley Orrin Staggers, whose district was one of the neediest in the country.

President Richard M. Nixon signed the National Health Service Corps into law in December 1970, just 10 months after Dr. Bergman had proposed it.

Working with Mr. Jackson’s office, Dr. Bergman also helped draft the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, which expanded funding for care to Native Americans, and lobbied for its passage on Capitol Hill.

“Jackson effectively added Abe to his staff for the legislative effort,” Mr. Redman recalled.

Abraham Baer Bergman, known as Abe, was born in Seattle on May 11, 1932, to Fred and Minnie (Hurwitz) Bergman. His father owned a luggage store, and his mother was a homemaker.

He graduated from Reed College, in Portland, Ore., in 1954 and received his medical degree from Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland in 1958. He was a pediatric resident at Boston Children’s Hospital and St. Mary’s Hospital in London, where he lived for a time.

Dr. Bergman began his career at Seattle Children’s Hospital, where he was director of outpatient services for 19 years, and then moved to Harborview Medical Center in that city, where he was chief of pediatrics from 1983 to 2005. He continued to serve on the faculty of the University of Washington School of Medicine until 2016.

His marriages to Judy Maslan, Ann Bigelow and Suzanne Fiala ended in divorce.

In addition to his son Ben, Dr. Bergman is survived by seven other children: Anna and Matthew Bergman, Sarah Bergman Lewis, Becca Bull and Pavel, Eugeny and Yulia Fiala, who were adopted from orphanages in Russia. He is also survived by six grandchildren.

When Dr. Bergman began researching crib death, experts had largely discarded its many supposed causes, including suffocation in bedclothes, allergy to cows’ milk and lead poisoning. A theory Dr. Bergman proposed was that infants experienced a spasm of the vocal cords that closed off the airway during sleep.

At a research conference in Seattle in 1969, the term sudden infant death syndrome was first formally proposed as a diagnosis.

In 1973, Dr. Bergman testified before Congress, armed with a report about how law enforcement, coroners and parents in 158 communities responded when a child died suddenly in a crib. There were discrepancies in how the health authorities treated parents of different races; only half as many Black parents as white parents were told their baby had died from SIDS. One Alabama coroner, quoted in the report, attributed a SIDS death to suffocation because “Blacks do not know how to care for their children properly.”

During the hearing, he castigated lawmakers for their inaction. “Maybe it’s the heat or maybe it’s the smog,” he said. “Government officials here in Washington are always busy, busy, busy with big problems.”

The Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Act was passed soon after.

Today, the cause of SIDS is still a medical mystery, but the incidence of deaths has declined sharply since 1990. The reason generally cited is an increase in public awareness of risk factors. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents put babies to sleep on their backs in their first year and that mothers breastfeed infants, which has been shown to lower the risk of SIDS.

Jerry Grinstein, a former Senate aide who became the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, recalled in an email that Dr. Bergman first approached Commerce Committee staff members about SIDS in the late 1960s, but that it took a few years to develop legislation and public support.

Committee members and staff “got the job done,” Mr. Grinstein wrote. “But it was Abe’s inspiration and persistence to use legislation supported by compelling stories from fellow professionals, plus hurting parents.”"
"U.S. Rate of Suicide by Firearm Reaches Record Level
Gun suicides increased from prepandemic rates in all racial and ethnic groups, but the degree of change differed drastically.

The rate of suicides involving guns in the United States has reached the highest level since officials began tracking it more than 50 years ago, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The rate increased by more than 10 percent in 2022 compared with 2019, and in some racial and ethnic groups, the rise was significantly steeper, especially among Native Americans. Overall, about 27,000 of 50,000 suicides were carried out by gun in 2022.

Federal researchers involved in the analysis suggested that the coronavirus pandemic might have exacerbated many of the known risk factors for suicide generally, which include social isolation, strained relationships, and drug and alcohol disorders. At the same time, outside experts noted, the increased rates also correlated with another trend seen during the acute phase of the pandemic: rising gun sales.

“When there are more firearms, there are more firearm suicides,” said Michael Anestis, the executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center.

The rate of suicide by any method has increased by one-third in the past two decades, according to federal data. More than half of those now involve firearms, the report said, a figure that translates to about one every 20 minutes.

On the flip side, more than half of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides.

To examine recent trends, federal researchers at the C.D.C.’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control compiled and analyzed demographic and mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System and the Census Bureau. (Statistics from 2022, the most recent available data, are still considered preliminary.)

They found that the firearm suicide rate in 2022 (8.1 per 100,000) was the highest level since at least 1968, the earliest year on record in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

Suicide rates have increased across all racial and ethnic groups since 2019, but the degree of change differed drastically. American Indian and Alaska Native people, for example, saw the sharpest spike: a 66 percent increase in the rate of firearm suicides from 2019 to 2022 (to 10.6 from 6.4 per 100,000). The rate among Black people increased by 42 percent (to 5.3 from 3.8), and among Hispanic and Latino people by 28 percent (to 3.3 from 2.5). Asian and Pacific Island people saw firearm suicide rates increase by about 10 percent (to 1.9 from 1.7).

White people experienced the smallest bump — a 9 percent increase since 2019 — but maintained the highest overall rate of firearm suicides (11.1 per 100,000 in 2022).

Sarah Burd-Sharps, the senior director of research at Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit group that aims to prevent gun violence, said the unparalleled increase in the rate among American Indian and Alaska Native communities could be caused by disparities in access to mental health care. She said the high levels of job loss and financial strains in Black and Latino communities during the pandemic could have contributed to the rise in those groups.

Dr. Anestis of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center said he was “sadly not surprised,” since the demographic groups driving the surge in firearm sales did not match the stereotype of “older, white, male gun owners.” Research showed that about half of first-time buyers during the pandemic were female, and an increasing proportion were Black and Hispanic.

Research shows that gun owners are no more likely than others to have suicidal thoughts, but surveys have showed that people who planned to purchase firearms during the pandemic were more likely to have thought recently about suicide than people without plans to purchase.

“When firearms are going into new types of communities, and into homes where people have had the propensity to think about suicide, they are suddenly gaining access to the single most lethal method,” Dr. Anestis said.

Researchers at the C.D.C. called for stronger efforts to reduce such suicides by addressing underlying inequities. Some states are working to develop safe options for storing guns away from a person’s home during times of distress.

Dr. Anestis is planning a project that could train barbers, faith leaders, bartenders and even divorce lawyers on how to help promote those options to people who are discouraged, “much like knowing who’s going to hold your car keys when you’ve had too much to drink,” he said.

“The goal is not to infringe upon their autonomy as an owner,” he said. “It’s to make sure that, in their worst moment, it’s not right there at their fingertips.”"
"Brain Study Suggests Traumatic Memories Are Processed as Present Experience
Traumatic memories had their own neural mechanism, brain scans showed, which may help explain their vivid and intrusive nature.

At the root of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a memory that cannot be controlled. It may intrude on everyday activity, thrusting a person into the middle of a horrifying event, or surface as night terrors or flashbacks.

Decades of treatment of military veterans and sexual assault survivors have left little doubt that traumatic memories function differently from other memories. A group of researchers at Yale University and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai set out to find empirical evidence of those differences.

The team conducted brain scans of 28 people with PTSD while they listened to recorded narrations of their own memories. Some of the recorded memories were neutral, some were simply “sad,” and some were traumatic.

The brain scans found clear differences, the researchers reported in a paper published on Thursday in the journal Nature Neuroscience. The people listening to the sad memories, which often involved the death of a family member, showed consistently high engagement of the hippocampus, part of the brain that organizes and contextualizes memories.

When the same people listened to their traumatic memories — of sexual assaults, fires, school shootings and terrorist attacks — the hippocampus was not involved.

“What it tells us is that the brain is in a different state in the two memories,” said Daniela Schiller, a neuroscientist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and one of the authors of the study. She noted that therapies for PTSD often sought to help people organize their memory so they can view it as distant from the present.

Understand Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
The invasive symptoms of PTSD can affect combat veterans and civilians alike. Early intervention is critical for managing the condition.
Understanding the Brain: Decades of treatment of military veterans and sexual assault survivors have left little doubt that traumatic memories work differently from other memories. A group of researchers set out to find empirical evidence of what makes them stand them apart.
E.M.D.R.: The once-experimental trauma treatment might look bizarre, but some clinicians say it’s highly effective against PTSD. Here’s how the therapy works.
Removing the Stigma: Misconceptions about how PTSD develops and its symptoms, can prevent people from seeking treatment.
Psychedelic Drugs: As studies continue to point to the therapeutic value of substances like MDMA, veterans are becoming unlikely advocates for their decriminalization.
“Now we find something that potentially can explain it in the brain,” she said. “The brain doesn’t look like it’s in a state of memory; it looks like it is a state of present experience.”

Indeed, the authors conclude in the paper, “traumatic memories are not experienced as memories as such,” but as “fragments of prior events, subjugating the present moment.”

The traumatic memories appeared to engage a different area of the brain — the posterior cingulate cortex, or P.C.C., which is usually involved in internally directed thought, like introspection or daydreaming. The more severe the person’s PTSD symptoms were, the more activity appeared in the P.C.C.

What is striking about this finding is that the P.C.C. is not known as a memory region, but one that is engaged with “processing of internal experience,” Dr. Schiller said.

The findings feed into a much debated question in the field of trauma: Should clinicians encourage people with PTSD to expose themselves to their most traumatic memories?

In recent years, many Americans have embraced treatments such as prolonged exposure therapy and eye movement reprocessing and desensitization, or EMDR, which revisit traumatic memories in hopes of draining them of their destructive force. Ilan Harpaz-Rotem, an author of the paper, said the new findings suggested that revisiting the memory was a critical element of treatment.

“You are helping the patient to construct a memory that can be organized and consolidated into the hippocampus,” said Dr. Harpaz-Rotem, a professor of psychiatry and psychology at Yale University.

He described a case from his clinic: An Army medic was haunted by a fragmentary image from his past, of frantically bandaging a solder’s wound while under fire. In therapy, trying to “build a story, a coherent memory,” the clinician helped the medic fill in details around the edges of that scene, including a dead soldier who lay nearby, shooting in the background, and his own panicked use of too many bandages.

Ideally, such treatments can help transform the traumatic memory into one that more closely resembles ordinary sad memories. “It’s like having a block in the right place,” he said. “If I can access a memory, I know it’s a memory. I know it’s not happening to me now.”

Dr. Ruth Lanius, the director of PTSD research at the University of Western Ontario who was not involved in the study, described its findings as “seminal,” both because it establishes that traumatic memories have distinct pathways and because it indicates that key mechanisms for traumatic memory may involve less-examined areas of the brain. Much research into PTSD has focused on the amygdala, the stress detection center of the brain, and the hippocampus, she said. The posterior cingulate cortex is “really involved in the reliving of memories,” and in seeking self-relevance, which may explain why a sensory reminder may cause overwhelming fear or panic.

“A soldier, if they hear fireworks, they may run and take cover,” Dr. Lanius said. “Traumatic memories are not remembered, they are relived and re-experienced.”

Clinicians, she said, can use these findings to treat patients who “don’t feel that the trauma is over,” employing therapies that “bring on line context, so you know, ‘Oh, that happened in the past.’” She said researchers should explore therapies, like mindfulness, which are known to activate the parts of the brain known to provide context.

If biological markers for PTSD can eventually be identified, it would be “a major scientific contribution,” settling differences within the field about what experiences constitute a trauma, said Brian Marx, deputy director of the Behavioral Science Division of the National Center for PTSD, who was not involved in the study.

While most experts agree that motor vehicle accidents, sexual assaults or military combat are traumatic events, there is disagreement about whether experiences like racism or pandemic stress should be viewed as the basis for a PTSD diagnosis, he said.

“It is one of the foundational questions of the field,” he said. “It is a debate we still wrestle with, because we don’t have an answer for it.”

Dr. Marx called the new research “intriguing,” but not conclusive, noting that it did not include a comparison group of subjects without a PTSD diagnosis, specify how long ago the traumatic events took place, or specify whether the subjects had already received psychotherapy.

And he said it was not likely to settle debates over whether PTSD treatments should include exposure to traumatic memories, since literature on treatment outcomes show that responses are highly individualized.

“To say this is proof positive really ignores the reality that our treatments are imperfect,” he said. “They don't work for everyone in the same way.”"
"Climate Change Drives New Cases of Malaria, Complicating Efforts to Fight the Disease
The number of malaria cases rose again in 2022, propelled by flooding and warmer weather in areas once free of the illness.

There were an estimated 249 million cases of malaria around the globe last year, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, significantly more than before the Covid-19 pandemic and an increase of five million over 2021. Malaria remains a top killer of children.

Those new cases were concentrated in just five countries: Pakistan, Nigeria, Uganda, Ethiopia and Papua-New Guinea. Climate change was a direct contributor in three of them, said Dr. Daniel Ngamije, who directs the W.H.O. malaria program.

In July 2022, massive flooding left more than a third of Pakistan underwater and displaced 33 million people. An explosion of mosquitoes soon followed. The country reported 3.1 million confirmed cases of malaria that year, compared with 275,000 the year before, with a fivefold increase in the rate of transmission.

“With the very heavy monsoons we expected these consequences, but not up to this magnitude,” said Dr. Muhammad Mukhtar, director of Pakistan’s national malaria control program.

While floodwaters have receded in some areas, vast tracts of standing water remain, and the malaria parasite is now well-established and circulating in communities that had little prior immunity, Dr. Mukhtar said.

More than seven million bed nets were given out to displaced people, but people who are living in small tents or in big crowded halls have nowhere to hang them, Dr. Mukhtar said. The country is relying on insecticide spraying to try to control mosquitoes and mass administration of anti-malarial drugs.

Pakistan has confirmed 2.3 million malaria cases so far this year and expects the total to be even higher than the total from 2022.

“It will take another one to two years for the situation to become normal if, God forbid, there is not another natural disaster,” Dr. Mukhtar said.

In Pakistan, as in other places where weather emergencies drove malaria’s spread, new mosquito habitat was only part of the problem. The floods damaged 2,200 health facilities, leaving millions of people without access to treatment in affected districts.

The number of deaths from malaria worldwide stayed largely stable between 2021 and 2022, but at an estimated 608,000 it was still significantly higher than the total of 576,000 in 2019, before the Covid pandemic.

Deaths had fallen steadily from 2000 to 2015, because of a wide push to make better diagnostics and treatments, as well as insecticide-treated bed nets, widely available across malarial areas in sub-Saharan Africa. But growing resistance to those drugs and insecticides, plus stagnating funding and changes in mosquito behavior, have combined to stall that progress. Covid has further disrupted both health services and supply chains.

The changing climate was also at least partly responsible for a rise in malaria in Ethiopia (with 1.3 million more cases than it had the year before) and Uganda (with 600,000 more), Dr. Ngamije of the W.H.O. said. Highland areas that had long been too cool and dry to support the breeding of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes have started to report cases in those two countries.

In Ethiopia, large civil conflicts that displaced millions of people also made them newly vulnerable to malaria. Conflict drove the spread of malaria in other areas, as well: Cases increased more than sevenfold in Myanmar, for example.

And Ethiopia is among African countries where an invasive mosquito species, Anopheles stephensi, which thrives in urban areas once largely free of malaria, is now spreading the disease.

In Uganda, there are also worrying signs that the malaria parasite is growing resistant to the main medication used to treat the disease.

Nigeria, the country with the highest burden of malaria, also saw extreme flooding in 2022. The country managed to keep the rate of new infections stable, but its rapid rate of population growth meant there were an additional 1.3 million cases.

Climate change is also driving malaria cases where people are displaced by drought, heat waves and storms, leaving them in substandard housing, Dr. Ngamije said. Weather disasters disrupt the supply chains of malaria tests, treatments and insecticides. Food insecurity, rising in sub-Saharan Africa because of floods and droughts, means more children are malnourished, and thus more susceptible to severe malaria. Repeated malaria infections keep children out of school, and wipe out the savings of the lowest-income families in affected countries.

The malaria report did contain some good news. Azerbaijan, Belize and Tajikistan were all certified as malaria-free by the W.H.O. in 2022.

More than two million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi had received at least one dose of a new malaria vaccine by the end of 2022. Vaccination coverage will be broadened to 12 more countries next year. There has been a 13 percent drop in child deaths over four years in the areas where the first malaria vaccine has been administered.

Dr. Ngamije said he had hoped that the 2022 malaria data would show global cases falling rather than rising. But the W.H.O.’s approval of a second malaria vaccine that will rapidly increase supply, plus the growing availability of bed nets treated with multiple kinds of chemicals to counter the effect of insecticide resistance, make him optimistic that there will be significant progress next year.

“If it turns out to be a normal year,” he said."
"U.S. Life Expectancy Creeps Up as Covid Deaths Fall
But the country’s health has not fully rebounded from the pandemic, according to new data from the C.D.C.

Life expectancy in the United States has begun to climb again as the threat of Covid-19 has receded, increasing by more than a year from 2021 to 2022, according to data released on Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The rise represents a slow and partial recovery for the country, which tallied more than 1.1 million Covid deaths and lost 2.4 years in life expectancy from 2019 to 2021.

But an array of other conditions continued to pose grave risks to Americans’ health. Deaths from flu, pneumonia, fetal and infant conditions and kidney disease all rose in 2022, the agency reported, partially offsetting the fall in Covid deaths.

“We’re halfway back to what we lost,” said Eileen Crimmins, an expert on gerontology and demography at the University of Southern California. “But we certainly have a very long ways to go before we get to where life expectancy should be.”

In 2022, life expectancy at birth was 77.5 years, compared with 76.4 years in 2021. A drop in Covid deaths accounts for more than 80 percent of that increase. In 2019, before the pandemic, life expectancy at birth was 78.8. Declines in deaths from heart disease, unintentional injuries (a category dominated by drug overdoses), cancer and homicide also contributed to the rise in life expectancy, the C.D.C. reported.

Elizabeth Arias, a researcher at the National Center for Health Statistics and an author of the new analysis, said that she had not been expecting the nation’s life expectancy to rebound completely in 2022, when Covid was the underlying cause of some 200,000 deaths. “They’re excess deaths,” she said. “They’re not part of our mortality DNA.”

Life expectancy has climbed considerably over the past century, from 47 years in 1900 to nearly 79 years just before the pandemic. (The long-term improvement has been driven in part by significant declines in infant mortality.)

But gains in life expectancy in the United States had slowed in recent decades compared with that of other wealthy nations, and life expectancy effectively flattened in the 2010s, a trend that experts have attributed in part to gaps in health care access, areas of deep poverty, risky behaviors like gun ownership and unhealthy physical and social conditions in the United States.

After past health catastrophes in the United States, like the 1918 influenza pandemic, life expectancy appeared to recover more rapidly than it has during the coronavirus pandemic, said Dr. Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University.

Some demographic differences narrowed in 2022 as groups that lost fewer years of life expectancy during the pandemic, like white and Asian Americans, recovered fewer years than groups that were hit harder by Covid.

The gains were pronounced among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, who were devastated by Covid, losing 6.2 years of life expectancy from 2019 to 2021. In 2022, they regained 2.3 years of those years, although their life expectancy of 67.9 remains lower than that of other demographic groups.

Life expectancy rose by 2.2 years for the Hispanic population and 1.6 years for Black Americans. The increases were more modest for Asian and white Americans, who gained 1.0 and 0.8 years of life expectancy in 2022.

A longstanding gap in life expectancy between the sexes widened during the pandemic, which brought a higher mortality rate in men than in women. In 2021, women could be expected to live six years longer than men, but that gap closed slightly, to 5.4 years, in 2022.

This narrowing may stem from the fall in Covid deaths and a potential plateauing of the opioid epidemic, said Dr. Brandon Yan, a physician and public health researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “Both of these have historically disproportionately killed men,” he said.

The United States lags behind many other wealthy nations, both for how many years of life expectancy it lost during the pandemic and for how slowly it has recovered.

Portugal, for example, had a life expectancy of nearly 82 years in 2022, only marginally lower than before the pandemic. Belgium, too, had nearly returned to its prepandemic peak of a 82-year life expectancy by 2022, while Sweden had entirely erased its losses from the pandemic and returned to an 83-year life expectancy last year.

Studies in recent years have shown that the pandemic deepened American deficits in survival rates that had been accumulating for decades, reflecting longstanding problems with chronic illness in the United States and the country’s difficulties in responding to Covid.

Despite having one of the world’s most robust stores of vaccines, the United States struggled to vaccinate as many people against Covid — and especially older people — as other large and wealthy nations did. And it fell behind in administering booster shots, too, leaving it more vulnerable as the Omicron wave swept the country.

While the C.D.C. said racial and ethnic disparities in life expectancy decreased slightly from 2021 to 2022 for some groups, glaring gaps remained.

White people, for example, were living nearly 10 years longer on average than Native Americans and Alaska Natives, who were battered by the pandemic and have long faced health problems stemming from poverty, discrimination and underfunded health services.

“The data makes clear that these longstanding inequities have not really been addressed,” said Michael Bird, a former president of the American Public Health Association and member of the Kewa Pueblo tribe. “It really goes back to poverty and the racism that is still being perpetuated.”

The pandemic was hardest on those who faced the steepest problems to begin with.

“It’s not an esoteric experience,” Mr. Bird said. “It’s the reality of knowing people who’ve passed on before their time.”

And many of the deaths in the United States are “in theory, wholly preventable,” said Philip Cohen, a sociologist and demographer at the University of Maryland. “It’s still violence and alcohol and suicide and homicide, accidents and especially opioids.”

Suicides rose 3 percent in 2022, the C.D.C. reported in a separate analysis on Wednesday. The agency had previously reported that the number of suicides had risen to nearly 50,000 in 2022, the most ever recorded in the United States.

“The U.S. is not doing its job when it comes to public health,” Dr. Cohen said."
"Innovative Cancer Treatment May Sometimes Cause Cancer, F.D.A. Says

The News
A lifesaving cancer treatment may itself cause cancers, the Food and Drug Administration reported on Tuesday.

The treatment, called CAR-T, was first approved in November 2017 for life-threatening blood cancers. But, the F.D.A. said, it had received 19 reports of new blood cancers in patients who received the treatment.

A Number That Sums It Up: Thousands of lives have been saved with CAR-T.
CAR-T involves removing a type of white blood cell — T cells — from a patient’s blood, then genetically engineering to make proteins — chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) — which allow the T cells to attach to cancer cells and kill them. The engineered cells are then infused back into the patient’s blood.

The F.D.A. has approved six commercial CAR-T products. Cancer specialists said the treatments have saved the lives of thousands of patients with blood cancers. Even if there is a causal link between the treatments and a small risk of a new blood cancer, the regulators said on Tuesday, the benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks. That sentiment was echoed by doctors involved in cancer treatment.

While the hypothetical risk was known, “we haven’t observed it” in patients, Dr. Marcela V. Maus, director of cellular immunotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital, said.

Dr. John DiPersio, director of the center for genetic and cellular immunotherapy at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said his center had treated 500 to 700 patients. And, he said, “I haven’t seen a single one” develop a new T cell cancer.

CAR-T therapy has been reserved for patients who would die without it, he added.

“They are all going to die and they are all going to die quickly without this treatment. It saves their life,” Dr. DiPersio said. “It works in a substantial portion of patients. The benefit is enormous.”

Facts to Keep in Mind: What triggered the F.D.A.’s investigation.
The F.D.A. said in its announcement that the reports of additional cancers included serious consequences — hospitalizations and deaths. And, the agency said, it is known that the way CAR-T cells are produced has a risk of causing cancers in recipients.

When patients’ T cells are engineered to make proteins that attack cancer cells, a virus helps slip new genes into T cell DNA. That has the potential to disrupt other genes, leading to cancer.

But there are other potential explanations. CAR-T therapy is used when patients have already had at least one round of conventional treatments with intense chemotherapy and, often, radiation. Those treatments can themselves elicit new blood cancers. Even without chemotherapy or radiation, Dr. Maus added, patients with blood cell cancers are especially susceptible to developing other blood cell cancers.

What Happens Next: The search for a smoking gun.
One unanswered question, Dr. Maus and Dr. DiPersio said, is whether the new cancers involved T cells carrying the added CAR proteins. That does not prove the gene insertion caused the cancers. But Dr. DiPersio said, “it is more of a smoking gun.”

The F.D.A. did not describe any anticipated outcomes of its investigation but said that it was “evaluating the need for regulatory action.”"
"France to Ban Smoking in Forests, on Beaches and Near Schools
A government anti-smoking plan also includes costlier cigarettes and a ban on disposable vapes. Smoking is the leading cause of avoidable deaths in France.

France will ban smoking on beaches, near public buildings like schools and in public parks and forests next year, the French government said on Tuesday, as it unveiled plans to curb the habit by making it slightly more expensive and far less attractive, especially to younger people.

“We have won battles,” Aurélien Rousseau, France’s health minister, said at a news conference in Paris. Noting that the smoking rate for 17-year-olds had already dropped to 16 percent in 2022 — down from 25 percent in 2017 — he added that “tobacco remains a major public health scourge.”

The government’s plan is part of an ambitious effort to produce the first “no-tobacco generation” by 2032.

While anti-smoking campaigners welcomed some of the measures announced by Mr. Rousseau, they said that lofty objective would be hard to achieve if the government did not act even more forcefully to push up the price of cigarettes.

Smoking rates in France have remained roughly unchanged since 2019 after decades of regularly declining, according to French public health authorities.

Luring FIFA: A plan promoted by the government of President Emmanuel Macron would encourage international sports bodies, including world soccer’s governing body, to move to the country by promising them tax breaks not available to French citizens and companies.
Immigration: Macron suffered an unexpected setback as lawmakers brought his government’s immigration reform bill to a screeching halt. The development casts fresh doubts on his ability to get key legislation approved.
A Higher Price: The Louvre Museum said that it would raise its basic ticket price to 22 euros beginning in January, in the latest sign that visitors may face higher costs ahead of next year’s Summer Olympics in Paris.
Glazed Doughnuts: Krispy Kreme has landed in France, and Parisians can’t get enough. It is just the latest arrival in a decades-long invasion by U.S. fast food.
Nearly a quarter of French adults, or about 12 million people, still smoke daily, compared with just 11.5 percent of U.S. adults who smoke regularly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And smoking is still the leading cause of avoidable mortality in France, causing about 75,000 deaths per year.

Mr. Rousseau said the government wanted to continue “de-normalizing” smoking in outdoor settings by making smoking-authorized areas the exception, not the rule. (Smoking inside most public establishments like restaurants, cafés and clubs has been strictly forbidden for more than a decade.)

Previously, local authorities had already barred people from smoking at more than 7,000 outdoor locations, including at beaches, forests and parks across the country, Mr. Rousseau said, but there was no nationwide ban.

Violators of the new ban could be fined, but Mr. Rousseau said the details of any penalties still needed to be worked out.

The government also wants to make tobacco increasingly unattractive for young people, mainly by banning disposable, single-use vapes that are heavily marketed toward teenagers, which would fulfill a promise that was first made by Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne in September.

Mr. Rousseau said those vapes — nicknamed “puffs” in France — were “each more colorful and attractive than the last” but were “an aberration from the point of view of public health or of their environmental impact.”

The government also wants to extend the requirement that all tobacco and vaping products have plain packaging, which is already required for cigarette packs.

Crucially, Mr. Rousseau said the government was aiming for a minimum price of 13 euros per pack of cigarettes, or about $14, by 2027. A pack currently costs about $12 on average in France.

Anti-smoking groups welcomed measures like the bans on outside smoking and on disposable vapes but said the planned price increases would not go far enough to significantly reduce smoking rates.

Marion Catellin, the director of the Alliance Against Tobacco, said the government’s target price for 2027 was too low — her organization was hoping for a price of 16 euros per pack — and that the cost of individual packs would likely reach 13 euros anyway through inflation.

Ms. Catellin said that if the government did not show “political courage” by raising taxes on cigarettes, it would struggle to reach the goal of a “no-tobacco” generation by 2032.

“We are very disappointed,” she said. “This plan represents a policy of small steps in the face of very ambitious objectives.”

The government can enact most of the measures announced by Mr. Rousseau by decree and will do so early next year, he said. The ban on disposable vapes will require legislation that is expected to go to Parliament next month. Mr. Rousseau said pharmacists will also be allowed to prescribe nicotine substitution medication to help smokers quit.

Countries around the world have taken conflicting public health approaches to smoking.

In May, Australia announced sweeping new regulations that aimed to reduce smoking and vaping, while neighboring New Zealand announced last week that it wanted to repeal a law — previously celebrated as a model for other nations — that would have gradually banned all cigarette sales in the country over the course of several decades."
"Could a Drug Give Your Pet More Dog Years?
Longevity drugs for our canine companions are moving closer to reality. They also raise questions about what it might mean to succeed.

The life of a pet dog follows a predictable trajectory. Over time, the floppy-eared puppy that keeps falling asleep in his food bowl will become a lanky-legged adolescent with an insatiable interest in squirrels — before eventually settling into adulthood as a canine creature of habit, with a carefully chosen napping location and a well-rehearsed greeting ritual.

But as the years progress, his joints will stiffen and his muzzle will gray. And one day, which will inevitably arrive too soon, his wagging tail will finally still.

“When you adopt a dog, you’re adopting future heartbreak,” said Emilie Adams, a New Yorker who owns three Rhodesian Ridgebacks. “It’s worth it over time because you just have so much love between now and when they go. But their life spans are shorter than ours.”

In recent years, scientists have been chasing after drugs that might stave off this heartbreak by extending the lives of our canine companions. On Tuesday, the biotech company Loyal announced that it had moved one step closer to bringing one such drug to market. “The data you provided are sufficient to show that there is a reasonable expectation of effectiveness,” an official at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration informed the company in a recent letter. (Loyal provided a copy of the letter to The Times.)

That means that the drug, which Loyal declined to identify for proprietary reasons, has met one of the requirements for “expanded conditional approval,” a fast-tracked authorization for animal drugs that fulfill unmet health needs and require difficult clinical trials. The drug is not available to pet owners yet, and the F.D.A. must still review the company’s safety and manufacturing data. But conditional approval, which Loyal hopes to receive in 2026, would allow the company to begin marketing the drug for canine life extension, even before a large clinical trial is complete.

“We’re going to be going for claiming at least one year of healthy life span extension,” said Celine Halioua, the founder and chief executive of Loyal.

Whether the drug will actually deliver on that promise is unknown. Although a small study suggests LOY-001 might blunt metabolic changes associated with aging, Loyal has not yet demonstrated that it lengthens dogs’ lives.

But the letter, which came after years of discussion between Loyal and the F.D.A., suggests that the agency is open to canine longevity drugs, Ms. Halioua said.

More are in the pipeline. A team of academic researchers is currently conducting a canine clinical trial of rapamycin, which has been shown to extend the lives of lab mice. And Loyal is recruiting dogs for a clinical trial of another drug candidate, dubbed LOY-002.

These developments are a sign of the accelerating pace of the science and the seriousness with which researchers and regulators are taking a field that once seemed like science fiction. They also raise questions about what it might mean to succeed, said Daniel Promislow, a biogerontologist at the University of Washington and a co-director of the Dog Aging Project, which is conducting the rapamycin trial.

“What if it works?” he said. “What are the implications?”

Lapping at the fountain of youth
Aging may be an inevitability, but it is not an unyielding one. Scientists have created longer-lived worms, flies and mice by tweaking key aging-related genes.

These findings have raised the tantalizing possibility that scientists might be able to find drugs that had the same life-extending effects in people. That remains an active area of research, but canine longevity has recently started to attract more attention, in part because dogs are good models for human aging and in part because many pet owners would love more time with their furry family members.

“There’s not a lot you wouldn’t do if you could stack the deck in your favor to preserve the life of your hairy, four-legged child,” said Ms. Adams, the Rhodesian Ridgeback owner.

The drugs currently under investigation act in different ways. Rapamycin, which has also attracted intense interest as a potential longevity drug for humans, inhibits a protein known as mTOR, which regulates cell growth and metabolism.

Earlier this year, a team of scientists including Dr. Promislow and some of his colleagues at the Dog Aging Project published an analysis of dogs that had been randomly assigned to receive either a low dose of rapamycin or a placebo for six months. Although the sample size was small, 27 percent of dog owners whose pets received the drug reported improvements in health or behavior, including increases in activity or playfulness, compared with 8 percent of owners whose dogs received a placebo.

LOY-001, an extended-release implant intended for large, adult dogs, is designed to modulate a different growth-related compound: insulinlike growth factor-1, or IGF-1. The IGF-1 pathway has been associated with aging and longevity in several species; in dogs, it is known to play a key role in determining body size. Although the idea remains unproven, some scientists hypothesize that high IGF-1 levels drive both rapid growth and accelerated aging in large dogs, which generally have shorter life spans than small ones.

Loyal’s own research, which has not yet been published, suggests that LOY-001 does reduce IGF-1 levels in dogs and that it might curb aging-related increases in insulin; an observational study of nearly 500 dogs also suggested that lower insulin levels were correlated with reduced frailty and a higher quality of life.

“It’s quite an exciting approach,” said Colin Selman, a biogerontologist of aging at the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the research and had not personally reviewed the company’s data.

But proving that a drug can actually extend canine lives will require large, time-consuming clinical trials. Although some are currently underway, it will be at least several more years before the results are in. And regardless of the drug, researchers will need to demonstrate that it adds good, healthy years to a dog’s life, rather than just drawing out their decline, experts said.

“If it proves true that it extends life span, I’m only interested in that if the period of life that is extended is good quality life,” said Dr. Kate Creevy, a veterinarian at Texas A&M and the chief veterinary officer of the Dog Aging Project. “I don’t want to make my dog live an extra two years in poor health.”

Canine conundrums
It is too soon to say what longevity drugs will cost, but Ms. Halioua predicted that LOY-001 would work out to “mid-double-digit dollars per month.”

For some owners, cost will not be a deterrent, said Karen Cornelius of Illinois, who has owned mastiffs and other “giant” breeds for decades. Many died when they were about 9 years old, said Ms. Cornelius, who runs several Facebook groups for owners of giant dogs.

“We were just having a discussion on one of my forums yesterday about how short-lived they were, and how people would give almost anything if they could extend that life,” she said.

Some ethicists worried that this enthusiasm could be exploited, especially if the drugs are advertised as fountains of canine youth while questions of long-term safety and efficacy remain unresolved. The dogs themselves cannot give consent, they noted.

“Is it in their best interest to live a little bit longer when there’s some risk to taking these drugs?” said Rebecca Walker, a philosopher and bioethicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who said she would not give a longevity drug to her golden retriever. “Or is it really in the best interest of their owners, who are very attached to them?”

So far, the worst side effect of LOY-001 has been mild and temporary gastrointestinal distress, Ms. Halioua said, although she acknowledged that the bar for safety would be “extremely, extremely, extremely high.”

Longevity drugs are intended for healthy dogs, which changes the risk-benefit calculus. “It’s one thing if a dog is on death’s door and you’re giving them some late-breaking treatment,” said Bev Klingensmith, a Great Dane breeder in Iowa who also has a Great Dane and a golden retriever of her own. “Giving my young, healthy dog a brand-new drug would seem a little scary.”

Even drugs that deliver on all their promises will raise ethical questions. “If animals are living longer, do we have the resources and commitment to provide lives worth living?” Dr. Anne Quain, a veterinarian and an expert on veterinary ethics at the University of Sydney, said in an email. “What if we see more dogs outliving their owners?”

Reforming the breeding practices that have contributed to life-shortening health problems in many dogs and expanding access to basic veterinary care might be a better way to improve canine lives, she added. “We can save many ‘dog years’ by ensuring that as many dogs have access to that care as possible,” she said.

And while scientists gather more data on potential longevity drugs, there are steps that dog owners can now take to foster healthier aging, experts said, including keeping their dogs lean and providing ample exercise and mental stimulation.

Ms. Halioua admitted to having a soft spot for senior dogs. “They just want a nice bed to sleep on,” she said, as her elderly Rottweiler, Della, napped. Della, who has lymphoma and dementia, is not on LOY-001 because enrolling her in the company’s studies would present a conflict of interest, Ms. Halioua said, but the dog seemed happy, she noted.

Ultimately, even if scientists can delay a pet owner’s heartbreak, they are unlikely to prevent it altogether. “These are definitely not immortality or radical life-span-extension drugs,” Ms. Halioua said in an email. She added, “Nothing we are developing could make a dog live forever.”"
"Egypt Wiped Out Hepatitis C. Now It Is Trying to Help the Rest of Africa.
Effective drugs that have made the disease curable have yet to reach most  of the region.

For seven years, Sulemana Musah put almost every bit of money that came his way into his war with hepatitis C.

His student loans for graduate school, his salary from his job as a high school teacher and the cash he earned from a side gig selling yams all went to tests and medicines to try to cure the virus that debilitated him. Mr. Musah, 27, who lives in Accra, the capital of Ghana, set aside dreams of starting a business, building a house, getting married.

He scraped together enough cash — $900, half his annual salary — to buy a course of the drugs  that, a decade ago, began to revolutionize hepatitis C treatment in the United States and other high-income countries.

He was the rare patient for whom that treatment wasn’t enough, so for years he tried, unsuccessfully, to save enough for another. “I was left just waiting for God to do his wonders,” he said.

Then in March, his doctor gave him extraordinary news: The Ghanaian government had received a donation of medications for hepatitis C. He could have treatment for free. Within weeks, Mr. Musah had the pills. In October, a blood test showed he was cured at last.

He was broke, exhausted — and ready to dust off his ambitions.

The donation came from a most unlikely source: Egypt, which only a few years ago had the world’s highest burden of hepatitis C. An estimated one in 10 people, about nine million Egyptians, were chronically infected. In a public health campaign extraordinary for both its scale and its success, Egypt screened its entire population, brokered a deal for hugely discounted drugs and cured almost everyone with the virus.

“This is one of the greatest accomplishments ever in public health,” said Dr. John W. Ward, the director of the Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination at the Task Force for Global Health.

Egypt is on track to be the first country to achieve the World Health Organization goal of eliminating hepatitis C, and it is leveraging that victory into a campaign of “health diplomacy,” pledging to donate drugs and share expertise, with the goal of treating a million African patients. It is an unusual gesture in the world of global health, where largess is typically delivered to developing countries from high-income nations.

“The Egyptian government saw an opportunity to extend its expertise beyond its borders and contribute to global health efforts,” said Khaled Ghaffar, Egypt’s minister of health and population. “This health diplomacy allows Egypt to leverage its success with hepatitis treatment for the greater benefit of humanity while simultaneously enhancing its standing among the global community.”

Globally, about 58 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C, according to the W.H.O., and the vast majority — 50 million — live in low- and middle-income countries. Four in five people don’t know they have the disease. About 300,000 people die each year of complications, particularly cirrhosis and liver cancer.

The virus is most commonly transmitted by blood; in high-income nations, it is often spread by unsanitary needles used for injecting drugs, while in developing countries transmission frequently happens in health care settings, either through unsterilized needles and instruments or in cutting by traditional healers. About a third of people clear the infection on their own, but in most people, it becomes chronic, slowly damaging the liver over time.

Yet few countries include the disease in their public health plans, or carry out testing to track the number of people infected. Hepatitis C has not been the focus of any large international programs, the way H.I.V. and malaria are, and it has been such a low priority in low-income countries that governments rarely even track how many people have it, let alone treat it. Until this year, in Ghana as in other African countries, only a handful of wealthy people were accessing hepatitis C treatment, using drugs they purchased privately.

The situation had been the same in Egypt until 2007. A mass vaccination campaign that began in the 1950s and for 20 years used improperly sterilized needles had accidentally spread hepatitis through the population. Few people could afford private treatment. When the government decided to start its national program, the virus was killing tens of thousands of people every year. At first, Egypt used two old drugs that only cured about half of those who were treated with them. But in 2013, Gilead Sciences Inc. brought to market an antiviral drug — the first cure for a viral infection in the history of medicine.

While the company was charging $1,000 for its once-a-day pill in the United States, Egypt negotiated to buy it for $10 a pill — and then arranged for Indian and Egyptian drug companies to make an even cheaper generic version in exchange for a royalty. Egypt has treated more than four million people, and cut hepatitis C prevalence to just 0.4 percent.

Other companies soon followed with more antivirals; they have been highly effective, safe, and thus far not bedeviled by the drug-resistance problems that often plague antivirals.

“The news on the drugs has only been good — the problem is that countries aren’t making the drugs available to the people in need,” said Dr. Ward, the coalition director.

Egypt chose Ghana as an early partner because it is investing in building up national health care. Dr. Yvonne Ayerki Nartey, a physician at Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, joined the Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination to put together a plan for Ghana’s new response. She needed first to figure out how many Ghanaians were infected and where they were; a national screening effort found that one in 20 people in the north of the country, an area where poverty rates are higher and health services weaker, had hepatitis C. She went on radio shows and spread word through Facebook and WhatsApp that treatment might soon be accessible.

Drugs were en route from Egypt, but the next step was tough: while a liver specialist would treat hepatitis in the United States, Ghana has fewer than 20 hepatologists. Dr. Nartey organized training courses for doctors in each district.

“Most have never treated hepatitis C before because treatment doesn’t happen here,” she said.

Most of the new treatment sites were teaching hospitals in regional centers, but she insisted on a pilot project at a rural hospital in an isolated region in the north, knowing that if Ghana was to truly wipe out the disease, frontline staff would have to be the ones to provide the treatment. The rural site had patients screened, tested and enrolled within a week.

Testing remained a problem: only private laboratories offered the viral load tests that are necessary to track hepatitis treatment, and they charged several hundred dollars per test. Dr. Nartey has 340 patients enrolled for potential treatment, but only 290 of them have been able to raise the funds for the viral load test they need to start. The new hepatitis program negotiated a lower rate, promising a steady flow of patients, but at about $80 per test, it remains the biggest challenge to the program.

For patients who had been living with not only the financial cost of the disease but also anxiety and fear as they saw relatives die of liver disease, the news of free treatment was almost unbelievable.

Mr. Musah first began to feel ill as a high school student living in a small town in the north. The hospital near his home couldn’t explain his back pain and feverish nights, and tested for everything from a dairy allergy to syphilis to H.I.V. After hundreds of dollars in tests, he was finally given a hepatitis diagnosis — but was told he would need a specialty hospital to help him. He traveled to Accra, where doctors said there were drugs, but he would have to pay for them.

In March, he joined other hepatitis patients at a celebration at a hotel in the capital where the Egyptian ambassador opened the free treatment program. But his challenges weren’t over. He needed the costly viral load tests to confirm the treatment was working; in September, he was faced with the choice of using a new student loan he took out to pay the tuition for a master’s degree, or for the test.

In scaling up the program across Ghana, Dr. Nartey hopes to screen two million people with a cheaper antigen test, which costs about a dollar per patient, and then run the viral load for the 200,000 she anticipates will have the antibodies, confirming active infection, and end up with 46,000 patients who can be treated, using the first tranche of drugs promised by Egypt. Her prevalence survey suggests this will leave another 300,000 still to treat.

“It’s a lot, but we’re ambitious,” she said.

Egypt is working to set up parallel hepatitis C programs in other countries including Chad and Sudan.

At the same time, Ghana is improving blood safety and injection practices, drawing on lessons from Egypt, and educating traditional healers, reducing the rate of new infections, Dr. Ward said.

He hopes that if Ghana manages to scale up its hepatitis program, it will spur neighboring countries to start their own.

“We have to get countries to realize the drugs exist and are so effective,” he said. ”We should be on a warpath to eliminate hepatitis C because it is so feasible.”

Mr. Musah said that when he got the news he was finally virus-free, it was like the start of a whole new life: no more spending much of each day wondering how he could pay for drugs or tests, or if he could do it before the virus killed him.

“Now I am free to plan a future,” he said."
"Unvaccinated and Vulnerable: Children Drive Surge in Deadly Outbreaks
About 60 million “zero-dose children” have not received any vaccines and have aged out of routine immunization programs. Protecting them will require a costly vaccination blitz.

Large outbreaks of diseases that primarily kill children are spreading around the world, a grim legacy of disruptions to health systems during the Covid-19 pandemic that have left more than 60 million children without a single dose of standard childhood vaccines.

By midway through this year, 47 countries were reporting serious measles outbreaks, compared with 16 countries in June 2020. Nigeria is currently facing the largest diphtheria outbreak in its history, with more than 17,000 suspected cases and nearly 600 deaths so far. Twelve countries, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, are reporting circulating polio virus.

Many of the children who missed their shots have now aged out of routine immunization programs. So-called “zero-dose children” account for nearly half of all child deaths from vaccine-preventable illnesses, according to Gavi, the organization that helps fund vaccination in low- and middle-income countries.

An additional 85 million children are under-immunized as a result of the pandemic — that is, they received only part of the standard course of several shots required to be fully protected from a particular disease.

The cost of the failure to reach those children is fast becoming clear. Deaths from measles rose 43 percent (to 136,200) in 2022, compared with the previous year, according to a new report from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The figures for 2023 indicate that the total could be twice as high again.

“The decline in vaccination coverage during the Covid-19 pandemic led us directly to this situation of rising diseases and child deaths,” said Ephrem Lemango, associate director of immunization for UNICEF, which supports delivery of vaccines to almost half the world’s children every year. “With each new outbreak, the toll on vulnerable communities rises. We need to move fast now and make the investment needed to catch up the children that were missed during the pandemic.”

One of the biggest challenges is that the children who missed their first shots between 2020 and 2022 are now older than the age group typically seen routinely at primary health care centers and in normal vaccination programs. Reaching and protecting them from diseases that can easily turn fatal in countries with the most fragile health systems will require an extra push and new investment.

“If you were born within a certain period of time, you were missed, full stop, and you’re not going to get caught just by restoring normal services,” said Lily Caprani, UNICEF’s chief of global advocacy.

UNICEF is asking Gavi for $350 million to purchase vaccines to try to reach those children. Gavi’s governing board will consider the request next month.

Unicef is urging countries to implement a catch-up vaccination blitz, an exceptional, one-time program to reach all the children between the ages of 1 and 4 who were missed.

Many developing countries have some experience of carrying out catch-up campaigns for measles, targeting children between 1 and 5, or even 1 and 15, in response to outbreaks. But now those countries also need to deliver the other vaccines and train personnel — typically community health workers who are only accustomed to vaccinating babies — and to procure and distribute the actual vaccines.

Dr. Lemango said that despite the urgency of the situation, it had been a struggle to get plans for such campaigns in place and that he hoped most could come together in 2024.

“Coming out of the pandemic, there was this hangover — no one wanted to do campaigns,” he said. “Everyone wants to return to normalcy and do regular strengthening of immunization. But we already had unfinished business.”

In some countries, such as Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia, health systems have recovered from severe Covid disruption and have regained or even surpassed the levels of vaccination coverage they had reached before the pandemic. But others — mostly countries where vaccination rates were already considerably lower than the targets set by UNICEF — have not caught up to their previously lower levels.

The countries with the most zero-dose children include Nigeria, Ethiopia, India, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. Many with the lowest levels of coverage are facing compounding challenges, such as the civil conflicts in Syria, Ethiopia and Yemen; the growing population of climate refugees in Chad; and both of those problems in Sudan.

Ghana’s experience is representative of the challenges of many lower-income countries. Parents couldn’t take their children for routine shots when communities were locked down to protect against Covid, and when those restrictions were lifted, many parents still stayed away because of fear of infection, said Priscilla Obiri, a community health nurse in charge of vaccinations in low-income fishing communities on the edge of the capital, Accra.

Of the children Ms. Obiri sees these days at a typical pop-up vaccination clinic, where she sets up a table and a few chairs in the shade at a crossroads, as many as a third will have incomplete vaccinations, or sometimes none at all, she said. She agrees on a plan with their mothers to make up the gap.

But some parents don’t, or can’t, bring their children to a clinic. “We must go out to the community and hunt for them,” she said.

As Ms. Obiri and her colleagues attempt to regain that lost ground, they face another challenge: disinformation campaigns and hesitation about Covid vaccines have spilled over and eroded some of the traditional eagerness that parents had to get their children routine immunizations, according to the Vaccine Confidence Project, a long-running research initiative at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

“In 55 countries, there was a precipitous drop between 2015 and 2022 in the number of people who said that routine immunization is important for children,” said the project’s director, Heidi Larson, whose team collected what she described as “robust global polling data” in more than 100 nationally representative surveys.

Even as people around the world were seeking information about vaccines, there was a surge in mis- and disinformation, she said, and people with low trust in officials and official guidance were particularly vulnerable to believing alternative sources of information.

In 2015, 95 percent of Ghanaian parents said they believed vaccines were safe. That figure plunged to 67 percent of parents in 2022. It had climbed back to 83 percent by October of this year.

Dr. Kwame Amponsah-Achiano, who oversees the childhood immunization program in Ghana, said he did not believe that confidence had fallen during the Covid pandemic. Demand remains high and has outstripped the program’s ability to supply in some areas, he said.

Ms. Caprani said UNICEF had found that both problems were occurring in parallel.

“You can have demand outstripping not just physical supply, but also outstripping access — convenient, affordable, reachable access — and simultaneously see some declining confidence,” she said. “It’s not necessarily the same people.”

Last year, 22 million children missed the routine measles vaccination given in their first year of life — 2.7 million more than in 2019 — while an additional 13.3 million did not receive their second doses. To reach herd immunity, and prevent outbreaks, 95 percent of children must have both doses. Measles acts as an early warning system for gaps in immunization, because it is highly transmissible.

“There are communities where an outbreak of measles is a bad thing, and there are communities where it’s a death sentence, because of the combination of other risk factors such as poor malnutrition, poor access to health care, poor access to clean water,” Ms. Caprani said."
"Cantaloupes Linked to Deadly Salmonella Outbreak, U.S. Says
Two deaths were reported in Minnesota, and the number of people sickened by salmonella has doubled since the outbreak was announced last week, federal officials said.

Two people have died in a salmonella outbreak linked to cantaloupes as cases have more than doubled since the outbreak was first announced last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The Food and Drug Administration said on Nov. 17 that it was investigating the outbreak. At that point, 43 cases and 17 hospitalizations had been reported in 15 states. As of Friday, federal officials had reported 99 cases in 32 states.

Several fruit producers have issued recalls for a number of cantaloupe and cantaloupe products that were distributed nationwide, the C.D.C. said.

Health officials asked consumers and business to throw away the recalled fruits, which include imported whole cantaloupes grown in Mexico labeled “Rudy” and “Malichita” and pre-cut cantaloupes sold under the “Vinyard,” “Aldi,” “Freshness Guaranteed” and “RaceTrac” brand names.

The C.D.C. posted a full list of the recalled fruits on its website.

As of Friday, at least two people in Minnesota had died and 45 people had been hospitalized. Health officials in Canada were also investigating the outbreak there.

“The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,” the C.D.C. said, adding that it usually takes three to four weeks to determine if a case is part of an outbreak.

Salmonella is a food-borne bacteria that infects people with a potentially fatal disease called salmonellosis.

The bacteria accounts for most of the food-borne illnesses reported in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with an estimated 1.35 million people reported sick every year.

More than 400 people in the United States die from the infection annually.

Symptoms can last for days and include diarrhea, fever and stomach pain. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune symptoms are especially vulnerable to the disease, which, in serious cases, is treated with antibiotics, according to the C.D.C.

The bacteria thrive in uncooked meats, though recent outbreaks have been linked to various food products such as diced onions, alfalfa sprouts, cookie dough and peanut butter.

The recalled cantaloupes are part of a recent rash of food-borne illness outbreaks.

Last month, diced onions were recalled in connection to another salmonella outbreak. This week, recalled peaches, nectarines and plums were linked to a listeria outbreak that caused one death.

"When the Neighbors Are All Older, Too
Some seniors prefer age-restricted communities, while others want intergenerational living. There is little research to show which option is healthier.

Kathy Fitts loved her roomy house in suburban Atlanta. But after her children moved out, and the pandemic exacerbated the isolation she often felt as a divorced woman, she left for Latitude Margaritaville, a Jimmy Buffett-themed housing development in Daytona Beach, Fla., for those “55 and better.”

Visiting a friend who had relocated there, “I thought, wow, these people are having a good time,” Ms. Fitts, 68, said. She bought a two-bedroom villa and settled in almost two years ago.

“I’m loving it,” she said. “There are so many things to do.” Traveling around in her golf cart, she plays bocce and bunco, takes birding walks and goes to tribute band concerts. You probably couldn’t pry her out with a crowbar.

Do older people benefit from living exclusively with other older people? That’s the standard model for senior housing of many configurations: independent and assisted living, continuing care retirement communities (also called life plan communities), 55-plus developments, subsidized affordable complexes.

But the prospect of life in an age-restricted development makes Robyn Ringler shudder. She and her husband, both retired in upstate New York, downsized from a big house on 30 rural acres to a rented one near an elementary school in suburban Albany.

“I love my friends who are the same age as me, but I adore meeting and knowing people of all ages,” said Ms. Ringler, who is 66. She meets people while biking through her neighborhood or walking her goldendoodle; she knows trick-or-treaters by name.

“It keeps me more engaged with the world,” she said. “It makes me feel part of a real community, a larger family.” As for the couple’s actual family, their adult daughter, who is about to start a new job, has moved in with them temporarily — something 55-plus communities typically ban.

Though surveys repeatedly show that most older people prefer to remain in their own homes as they age, about 800,000 were in assisted living last year, according to LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit aging services providers. An additional 745,000 lived in continuing care communities and three million in federally supported affordable senior housing.

The National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care estimates that 540 active adult communities with 82,000 units offer market-rate rental properties for seniors. In other 55-plus developments, residents purchase houses and condos.

Age-restricted housing often requires a middle- or upper-middle-class income. Homes at the Margaritaville community in Daytona Beach, for example, start at about $300,000.

At Riderwood, a continuing care community in Silver Spring, Md., that Lynn Cave moved into in 2021, the entrance fee for her one bedroom-plus-den apartment was $270,000 (90 percent is refundable after a resident moves out or dies). Her $3,300 monthly fee includes utilities; cable, phone and internet; use of the pool and fitness center; and 30 meals a month.

Often, as in Ms. Cave’s case, the sale of a house covers the costs. Low-income seniors have far fewer options.

Yet research on whether age-segregated housing leads to improved health or quality of life is scant and dated; it’s not a subject that lends itself to controlled studies. “It’s still an open question,” said Jennifer Molinsky, director of the Housing an Aging Society program at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.

The motives for relocating vary, of course. Ms. Cave, 67, moved to Riderwood because “I was the daughter who had to take care of parents from afar, and I swore I’d never do that to my kids,” she said.

At first, Ms. Cave recalled, “I looked around and saw the walkers and the scooters and thought, ‘My God, what have I done?’” Now, though, she appreciates the community college courses offered on campus, the square dancing and the pickleball, the shared meals. “The people are so interesting,” she added.

Such graduated communities allow residents to transfer to assisted living, nursing care or memory care units as their health declines. It’s a benefit that Carol Holmes Alpern, 81, learned to value after she and her husband, Bowen Alpern, moved into Foulkeways, a nonprofit Quaker-affiliated continuing care community in Gwynedd, Pa.

A healthy 68-year-old when he arrived in 2021, Mr. Alpern was diagnosed with a brain tumor the following year. When his wife could no longer care for him by herself, he entered hospice care in the Foulkeways nursing center, a short walk from the couple’s apartment. Having the option of 24-hour aides and unlimited visiting hours “probably saved my life,” Ms. Alpern said.

Her husband died last month, and now, “I can’t imagine leaving,” she said. Other residents “not only supported both of us, they cherished us.”

No such safety net awaits residents of so-called active adult communities, age-restricted developments that can offer rentals or homeownership. But “I see why they’re popular,” Dr. Molinsky said.

“They’re lower maintenance than a single-family home,” she said. “They’re more likely to have accessibility features. If the design is thoughtful, with proximity, you have opportunities to socialize.” And municipalities are more apt to approve projects that don’t increase school budgets.

But Toni Keyes, 65, moved into an apartment in a small 62-plus community in Clearlake, Calif., last year after the single-family homes she had been renting were sold, twice. A retired library worker living on Social Security disability, she found the apartment rent affordable with her federal Section 8 voucher, but the environment unwelcoming and unpleasant.

“It’s like a ghost town, always quiet,” said Ms. Keyes, who also remains very conscious of being the only Black tenant. “It feels like a nursing home.

“Being surrounded by all seniors is very limiting,” she added. “There should be a mix of age groups.”

That’s difficult to find, but “I definitely see growing interest in creating models of intergenerational housing,” Dr. Molinsky said. Some developers and operators have introduced mixed-age programs within senior housing or have built complexes that place senior buildings next to all-age apartments.

In Long Island City, N.Y., for instance, the Gotham Organization last year opened an 11-story senior independent living building, part of 1,132 units of housing at rents that range from low to upper income.

Though older residents, whose units provide grab bars and other safety features, and younger tenants don’t live side by side, they share a rooftop farm and other amenities and programs that encourage interaction. “They’re in the same ecosystem,” said Bryan Kelly, president of development.

Another Gotham development on the Lower East Side of Manhattan will incorporate a Jewish cultural center at the base of the senior building and a large community center in the adjacent all-ages building. “The days of the suburban model, the circular drive-up, are over,” Mr. Kelly said. He expects “more integrated, walkable, active, mixed use” senior housing.

Creating intergenerational housing will require federal and local policy changes, said Robyn Stone, senior vice president for research at LeadingAge. “We don’t have the regulatory environment that allows some of these things to happen, or the incentives to encourage and support them,” she said.

A few experiments in intergenerational living serve as proof of concept. In Oregon, Bridge Meadows has developed three communities, with more to come, for older adults and for families adopting or fostering children from the foster care system.

Treehouse Communities has built a similar combination in Easthampton, Mass. Olmsted Village in Mattapan, a Boston neighborhood, will offer homeownership to middle-income families along with apartments to fostering and adopting families — and to seniors who will mentor them. Some Cohousing communities are seniors-only, but others draw residents of all ages.

For now, though, when older people want or need to leave their homes, they usually acquire neighbors who are also, exclusively, older.

“I don’t know, if you asked people, if that’s what they want,” said Susan Popkin, a fellow and housing researcher at the Urban Institute. “But we haven’t asked.”"
"Cockroaches and Mountains of Trash Plague Acapulco After Hurricane
Residents complain of rashes and stomach ailments as 666,000 tons of garbage overwhelm the city. Uncollected waste after natural disasters can lead to illnesses, experts said.

Below the shattered windows of the high-rise hotels in downtown Acapulco, people walk alongside towering hills of garbage bags filled with rotting food and debris, from mattresses to Christmas decorations. Volunteer firefighters from distant states clear the waste, wiping away swarms of cockroaches from their arms.

Miles from the coastal beachside resorts, Elizabeth Del Valle, 43, listened as her teenage daughter Constanza Sotelo described the “mountains of trash” still blocking many streets surrounding their home.

“We have no way to find face masks to keep ourselves healthy,” said Ms. Del Valle. “We expect that we’re going to get an infection from the smell, from the garbage.”

Weeks after Hurricane Otis shocked forecasters and government officials by intensifying rapidly into the strongest storm to hit Mexico’s Pacific Coast and devastate much of Acapulco, residents say they now face an unfolding public health disaster.

Many locals, public health officials and emergency responders say they believe that the uncollected garbage is linked to stomach infections, diarrhea and skin rashes and other ailments that people have complained about since the storm.

Local business groups this past week called on federal and state officials to declare a sanitary emergency citing “the accumulation of garbage, construction material, lack of potable water and the presence of insects and harmful fauna,” including human remains.

As thousands of troops descended on Acapulco after Otis made landfall, authorities first prioritized clearing debris and restoring power to the tourist resort areas, according to city officials, local business leaders and residents. Some hotels in that area have since reopened.

But people who live outside the city’s beachfront tourist neighborhoods say they must navigate so many piles of trash and debris that in some places it is hard to reach hospitals and health centers.

Even as the authorities respond to Acapulco’s many needs — providing water to residents, restoring power and finding missing people — federal and local officials are sounding alarms over the hurricane’s longer-term health consequences and say that clearing trash needs to be priority.

The city’s mayor estimates that 666,000 tons of garbage are piled across Acapulco. Under normal conditions, local officials said, 700 to 800 tons of waste are picked up every day.

Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised a quick recovery, saying that families in Acapulco will be “content by Christmas.”

The mayor, Abelina López Rodríguez, believes the timeline will be far longer. “To say that in one month or five months we will rebuild Acapulco would be a lie,” she said.

The president’s support is vital, Ms. López Rodríguez said, “because garbage does not forgive.” The situation could soon become “a health crisis,” she added.

Since Otis ravaged Acapulco — killing at least 50 people and leaving 30 missing — health brigades made up of federal workers have cleaned and disinfected a little more than one-third of the city’s 507 neighborhoods, disposing of hundreds of pounds of rotting food, Mexican officials said.

Natural disasters can often result in an outbreak of infectious diseases, public health experts said. Piles of garbage left outside can attract mosquitoes and rats, which can then spread infectious diseases. A lack of power can also lead to contaminated food, raising the risk of stomach infections and illnesses.

After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported skin lesions, diarrhea and pneumonia among evacuees.

Health problems linked to uncollected trash are “more common than we anticipate,” said Amber Mehmood, an associate professor of public health at the University of South Florida who focuses on global health and disaster management. Debris and waste, she said, can become a “breeding ground for mosquitoes that can carry malaria and Zika virus.”

“There are plenty of reasons to be worried,” Ms. Mehmood added.

Leslye Solís Mireles, 31, a firefighter and paramedic leading a team of more than 50 firefighters from another Mexican state, said her crew in Acapulco had helped treat people with various illnesses that she believes stem from the accumulating garbage.

“It is literally a source of infection,” she said, adding that she and many of her own firefighters were now suffering stomach infections and skin rashes.

Ms. López Rodríguez said her government would have to expand the city’s landfill and find more equipment to get rid of the enormous amount of garbage. Acapulco needs 500 trucks to clear the debris; as of now the city has roughly 150 available, she said.

So far, more than 211,000 tons of garbage has been collected, according to the Guerrero state government.

Otis also destroyed 12,500 utility poles in the city, the mayor said, though the electricity commission said on Friday that 89 percent of users in Acapulco have had power restored. But thousands who had their homes severely damaged still lacked electricity, most of them in poor or outer rural neighborhoods, city officials said.

Ms. López Rodríguez is pleading for patience among her frustrated constituents. By the end of the year, she is focused “on having at least our streets clean, our houses clean, to having the water and electricity systems up and running.”

“I appeal to understanding, because a natural phenomenon of such magnitude exceeds any effort that is quick,” Ms. López Rodríguez added. “I don’t want to say that it can’t be done, but it can’t be done from one day to the next.”

W. Craig Fugate, an administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency under President Barack Obama, said that clearing debris from the streets was also vital to allow access to vehicles carrying supplies.

Beyond the health threat, Acapulco also needs to ensure that it is ready to welcome tourists, he said. “The last thing I want if I’m able to get anything open,” Mr. Fugate said, “is the smell of rotten garbage in my street. It’s a nuisance, potentially a public health risk, but it’s also an eyesore.”

But some residents in rural areas of Acapulco say they have waited long enough.

On a recent afternoon, Maricruz Balboa rushed down from her hillside neighborhood when she heard that businessmen from another state were giving away supplies from a box truck parked on the side of the street. A crowd of desperate residents reached for soap, hand sanitizer, food and sneakers.

“We’ve had almost no help here so far,” said Ms. Balboa, 48, showing the treasured items she had been given: a couple of water bottles, fruit, vegetables, shampoo and sanitary pads.

Ms. Del Valle made sure to get hand sanitizer from the same truck when it parked near her neighborhood. She said it was the first time someone had come to deliver food and supplies to her community.

“The government is giving as much as it can,” she said. “But it’s not enough.”

There are some signs of a comeback. Various businesses — al pastor restaurants, barber shops and fruit stands — have reopened.

Residents have on their own cleaned debris outside their homes. On a recent Wednesday afternoon, children played with a kite in one area of a grassy field otherwise filled with trash.

“Whether you are a government official or not, whether you have money or not, there is support,” Octaviano Roque Ruiz, 75, a retired teacher, said as he walked out of a tent where government officials were handing out stipends to older people to help them recover from the storm.

Already diagnosed with high blood pressure and diabetes before the storm, Mr. Ruiz said he now had intestinal pain and what appeared to be conjunctivitis. He had tried to go to the hospital recently but was told that it was beyond capacity and to return another day.

Other residents said conditions in Acapulco had made it impossible to live there for now.

Nicolás Linares, 59, left Acapulco briefly after Otis made landfall to join his brother in Zihuatanejo, a coastal resort about 150 miles north, but returned this month after hearing rumors that services had been restored.

“And I arrive and it’s not true,” he said, adding that the room he rents in the city had no electricity or water.

Mr. Linares tried to return to Zihuatanejo on a recent afternoon, but no more tickets were available at the bus station. He said he would return the next day.

“Now I have to go back to my neighborhood,” he said. “I have no other choice.”

"W.H.O. Says China Has Shared Data Indicating No Novel Pathogen
The W.H.O. had requested detailed information about a reported surge in respiratory illnesses in children in China. Chinese data suggested the surge was caused by known bacteria and viruses.

The World Health Organization said that China had shared data about a recent surge in respiratory illnesses in children, one day after the agency said it was seeking information about the possibility of undiagnosed pneumonia cases there.

The Chinese data indicated “no detection of any unusual or novel pathogens,” according to a W.H.O. statement on Thursday. The data, which included laboratory results from infected children, indicated that the rise in cases was a result of known viruses and bacteria, such as influenza and mycoplasma pneumoniae, a bacterium that causes usually mild illness.

Hospital admissions of children had increased since May, as had outpatient visits, but hospitals were able to handle the increase, China told the global health agency.

The W.H.O. requested information after Chinese news reports, and social media posts, indicated a notable surge in sick children in recent weeks. Parents reported long lines, sometimes of eight hours or more, at children’s hospitals. China’s National Health Commission acknowledged the reports of overcrowding.

Some of those reports also caught the attention this week of members of ProMED, a disease tracking site run by the International Society for Infectious Diseases that health officials monitor for early warnings of potential emerging diseases.

China’s transparency in reporting outbreaks has been the subject of intense global scrutiny, after it covered up early cases of both the SARS virus in 2003 and the virus that led to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The W.H.O. early this year rebuked Chinese officials for withholding data that the agency said could shed light on the coronavirus’s origins.

The W.H.O. issued its formal request for data one day after a ProMED member shared a news report from Taiwan about an uptick in sick children in Beijing and Liaoning, a northeastern Chinese province. Chinese officials had already publicly acknowledged an increase in respiratory diseases among children, but the W.H.O. said it was unclear at the time whether that increase was caused by known pathogens.

“A key purpose was to identify whether there have been ‘clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia’ in Beijing and Liaoning, as referred to in media reports,” the W.H.O. statement said.

The W.H.O. said the increased infections in China were earlier in the season than historically expected but “not unexpected,” given that this was the first winter since China had lifted the stringent coronavirus restrictions it imposed in 2020. Other countries experienced similar leaps in other illnesses after lifting their Covid controls."
"Deaths From Coal Pollution Have Dropped, but Emissions May Be Twice as Deadly
Deaths linked to coal exhaust have dropped but coal exhaust is twice as likely to contribute to deaths as other air pollution, a new study found.

Coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, is far more harmful to human health than previously thought, according to a new report, which found that coal emissions are associated with double the mortality risk compared with fine airborne particles from other sources.

The research, published Thursday in the journal Science, linked coal pollution to 460,000 deaths among Medicare recipients aged 65 and older between 1999 and 2020.

Yet the study also found that during that period the shuttering of coal plants in the United State, coupled with the installation of scrubbers in the smokestacks to “clean” coal exhaust, has had salubrious effects. Deaths attributable to coal plant emissions among Medicare recipients dropped from about 50,000 a year in 1999 to 1,600 in 2020, a decrease of more than 95 percent, the researchers found.

“Things were bad, it was terrible,” Lucas Henneman, the study’s lead author, and an assistant professor in environmental engineering at George Mason University, said in an interview. “We made progress, and that’s really good.”

Researchers from six universities collected emissions data from 480 coal power plants between 1999 and 2020. They used atmospheric modeling to track how sulfur dioxide converted into particulate matter and where it was carried by wind, and then examined millions of Medicare patient deaths by ZIP code.

Though the researchers could not identify exact causes of death, the statistical model showed that areas with more airborne coal particulates had higher death rates.

Some 138 coal plants each contributed to at least 1,000 excess deaths, and 10 plants were linked to more than 5,000 deaths apiece, the researchers found.

While fine particulate matter, known as P.M. 2.5, is frequently examined for its health risks, the researchers found that inhaling those fine particles from coal exhaust was especially deadly.

Breathing in coal exhaust was associated with more than double the mortality risk compared with inhaling fine particulates from other sources, the researchers determined.

They also published an online tool showing deaths attributed to individual coal-fired power plants.

“We can’t say how long these people would’ve lived without exposure,” Dr. Henneman said. “But we are saying they died earlier than they otherwise would have because of this coal pollution.”

Requirements that coal-fired power plants “scrub” the pollutants they emit, by removing sulfur dioxide using a cloud of water droplets, proved a game changer for public health.

After scrubbers were installed in 2009 and 2010 at the Keystone power plant in Pennsylvania, the average number of annual deaths linked to the plant dropped to 80 from 640, the researchers found. They also found that the average level of coal P.M. 2.5 across the United States dropped to 0.07 micrograms in 2020 from 2.34 micrograms per cubic meter of air in 1999.

“People today are living longer without as much of this coal pollution in the air,” Dr. Henneman said. “It’s this major success story.” Coal use is declining in the United States, but is increasing worldwide. It is projected to peak in 2025, at which point renewable energy sources are forecast to become the largest source of electricity production.

The new study in Science adds to mounting evidence of the health benefits that come from moving away from the burning of fossil fuels, especially for vulnerable populations.

In California, the addition of 20 zero emission vehicles for every 1,000 people in a given ZIP code correlated to a 3.2 percent drop in the rate of asthma-related emergency room visits, according to a study published earlier this year in the journal Science of the Total Environment.

In Chicago, the closure of three coal-fired plants was followed by a 12 percent decrease in asthma-related emergency room visits for children aged 4 and under living in the area relative to rates in places farther away, according to research published in 2021 in the American Journal of Public Health.

And after a large coal-processing plant shut down in Pittsburgh in 2016, there was an immediate 42 percent drop in weekly hospital visits for heart-related problems for nearby residents, another study found. The health benefits continued, with 33 fewer hospitalizations for heart disease on average for each of the three years after the plant’s closure compared with the three years before.

In May, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules that would cap the amount of pollutants that power plants could pump out, and estimated there’d be up to $85 billion in climate and health benefits. But given how deadly coal particulates have been found to be, Dr. Hennemen said the benefits would likely be far greater. Stronger curbs on tiny airborne particles could also result in a 7 percent drop in death rates for Black and low-income older people who have long been subjected to the country’s most polluted air, according to research published earlier this year.

"A Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance
Deciding when, or whether, to buy long-term care insurance can be complex. Here’s what to know.

If you’re wealthy, you’ll be able to afford help in your home or care in an assisted-living facility or a nursing home. If you’re poor, you can turn to Medicaid for nursing homes or aides at home. But if you’re middle class, you’ll have a thorny decision to make: whether to buy long-term care insurance. It’s a more complex decision than for other types of insurance because it’s very difficult to accurately predict your finances or health decades into the future.

What’s the difference between long-term care insurance and medical insurance?
Long-term care insurance is for people who may develop permanent cognitive problems like Alzheimer’s disease or who need help with basic daily tasks like bathing or dressing. It can help pay for personal aides, adult day care, or institutional housing in an assisted-living facility or a nursing home. Medicare does not cover such costs for the chronically ill.

How does it work?
Policies generally pay a set rate per day, week or month — say, up to $1,400 a week for home care aides. Before buying a policy, ask which services it covers and how much it pays out for each kind of care, such as a nursing home, an assisted-living facility, a home personal care service or adult day care. Some policies will pay family members who are providing the care; ask who qualifies as a family member and if the policy pays for their training.

You should check to see if benefits are increased to take inflation into account, and by how much. Ask about the maximum amount the policy will pay out and if the benefits can be shared by a domestic partner or spouse.

How much does it cost?
In 2023, a 60-year-old man buying a $165,000 policy would typically pay about $2,585 annually for a policy that grew at 3 percent a year to take inflation into account, according to a survey by the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, a nonprofit that tracks insurance rates. A woman of the same age would pay $4,450 for the same policy because women tend to live longer and are more likely to use it. The higher the inflation adjustment, the more the policy will cost.

If a company has been paying out more than it anticipated, it’s more likely to raise rates. Companies need the approval of your state’s regulators, so you should find out if the insurer is asking the state insurance department to increase rates for the next few years — and if so, by how much — since companies can’t raise premiums without permission. You can find contacts for your state’s insurance department through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ directory.

Should I buy it?
It’s probably not worth the cost if you don’t own your home or have a significant amount of money saved and won’t have a sizable pension beyond Social Security. If that describes you, you’ll probably qualify for Medicaid once you spend what you have. But insurance may be worth it if the value of all your savings and possessions excluding your primary home is at least $75,000, according to a consumers’ guide from the insurance commissioners’ association.

Even if you have savings and valuable things that you can sell, you should think about whether you can afford the premiums. While insurers can’t cancel a policy once they’ve sold it to you, they can — and often do — raise the premium rate each year. The insurance commissioners’ group says you probably should consider coverage only if it’s less than 7 percent of your current income and if you can still pay it without pain if the premium were raised by 25 percent.

Many insurers are selling hybrid policies that combine life insurance and long-term care insurance. Those are popular because if you don’t use the long-term care benefit, the policy pays out to a beneficiary after you die. But compared with long-term care policies, hybrid policies “are even more expensive, and the coverage is not great,” said Howard Bedlin, government relations and advocacy principal at the National Council on Aging.

When should I buy a policy?
Wait too long and you may have developed medical conditions that make you too risky for any insurer. Buy too early and you may be diverting money that would be better invested in your retirement account, your children’s tuition or other financial priorities. Jesse Slome, executive director of the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, says the “sweet spot” is when you’re between the ages of 55 and 65. People younger than that often have other financial priorities, he said, that make the premiums more painful.

When can I tap the benefits?
Make sure you know which circumstances allow you to draw benefits. That’s known as the “trigger.” Policies often require proof that you need help with at least two of the six “activities of daily living,” which are: bathing, dressing, eating, being able to get out of bed and move, continence, and being able to get to and use the toilet. You can also tap your policy if you have a diagnosis of dementia or some other kind of cognitive impairment. Insurance companies will generally send a representative to do an evaluation, or require an assessment from your doctor.

Many policies won’t start paying until after you’ve paid out of your own pocket for a set period, such as 20 days or 100 days. This is known as the “elimination period.”"
"How Many Abortions Did the Post-Roe Bans Prevent?
The first estimate of births since Dobbs found that almost a quarter of women who would have gotten abortions carried their pregnancies to term.

The first data on births since Roe v. Wade was overturned shows how much abortion bans have had their intended effect: Births increased in every state with a ban, an analysis of the data shows.

By comparing birth statistics in states before and after the bans passed, researchers estimated that the laws caused around 32,000 annual births, based on the first six months of 2023, a relatively small increase that was in line with overall expectations.

Until now, studies have shown that many women in states with bans have ended their pregnancies anyway, by traveling to other states or ordering pills online. What they have been unable to show is how many women have not done so, and carried their pregnancies to term. The new analysis, published Friday as a working paper by the Institute of Labor Economics, found that in the first six months of the year, between one-fifth and one-fourth of women living in states with bans — who may have otherwise sought an abortion — did not get one.

“The importance of our results is when you take away access, it can affect fertility,” said Daniel Dench, an economist at Georgia Tech and an author of the paper with Mayra Pineda-Torres of Georgia Tech and Caitlin Myers of Middlebury College. “When you make it harder, women can’t always get out of states to obtain abortion.”

Overall, data suggests that the number of legal abortions nationwide has stayed steady or slightly increased since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, despite abortion bans in what are now 14 states. This is probably because of new clinics that opened in states where it is legal, and the emergence of new ways to order abortion pills online, expanding access for both women who traveled to those states and those who lived there.

“This is an inequality story,” Professor Myers said. “Most people are getting out of ban states, one way or another, and more people in protected states are getting abortions. And at the same time, this shows something those data cannot show: There’s a significant minority of people in ban states that do get trapped.”

Births increased after states imposed abortion bans
The difference in births between states with bans and states without

The researchers used birth data, by age and race, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2005 through June 2023. They used a statistical method that compared states with similar trends in births before the Dobbs decision to estimate how much a ban changed the expected birthrate. This increased their certainty that the change was because of the policy and not other factors.

They found that births increased 2.3 percent, on average, in states with bans relative to states where abortion remained legal.

The analysis showed that the increased births were disproportionately among women in their 20s and Black and Hispanic women, which researchers said could be because these groups tend to be poorer, making it harder to travel. They are also the demographic groups that have tended to be more likely to seek abortions.

Dr. Alison Norris, who studies reproductive health at Ohio State and was not involved in the study, said she was not surprised to see births increasing, particularly among those groups. She noted that before Dobbs, abortion access was already limited in many states, so “any measure of change that we see will in some ways be an underestimate of the challenges that people experience.”

The biggest increases in births were in states where women had to travel the farthest to reach an abortion clinic. Texas, where the average increase in driving distance to the nearest abortion clinic was 453 miles, had a 5.1 percent increase in births, relative to states that did not pass a ban but had similar trends before Dobbs. Mississippi, where it increased 240 miles, had a 4.4 percent increase.

In states where there was less of a change in driving distance to the nearest clinic, there was a smaller relative change in births. Missouri, for instance, had only one clinic, in St. Louis. When it closed, the average driving distance to the nearest clinic increased only two miles, because clinics along the Illinois border were already serving Missourians. Births there increased just 0.4 percent.

There was also evidence that online abortion pills ordered from overseas vendors played a role in some states. The three states in which the increases in births were less than the researchers had predicted based on travel distances — Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana — also had large increases in orders for medication abortions from the largest overseas provider, according to an analysis of those orders.

“The insinuation of a lot of coverage of such data points is that it’s a bad thing for there to be more children welcomed in states with better laws than in states that fast-track abortion,” said Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life of America, in an email. “It’s a triumph that pro-life policies result in lives saved.”

The data on births is preliminary: A fuller accounting of the effect of Dobbs on the fertility rate, including county-level data, will not be available for another year. The researchers can’t be certain that the increase in births is attributed to women who wanted abortions but couldn’t get them, but the timing and consistency of the results suggest so.

The researchers said these trends could change as more birth data becomes available. The women giving birth in the first half of the year would have already been pregnant when abortion bans began, or they became pregnant soon after. Since the data ended, there have been new restrictions on abortion in some places, and access has expanded in others.

Births could decline. New shield laws aim to legally protect providers who mail abortion pills to states with bans, and people might be changing their behaviors around sex and contraception in response to bans. Or births could increase as more states restrict abortion; some of this may depend on the outcome of a case to restrict the mailing of one of the two abortion pills.

“The abortion landscape continues evolving,” Professor Pineda-Torres said. “People are adjusting, providers are adjusting, laws are adjusting.”"
"How Viral Infections Cause Long-Term Health Problems
In a few patients, the immune system becomes misdirected, attacking the body instead of the virus.

Every day, Davida Wynn sets herself one task: Take a bath. Or wash the dishes. Or make an elaborate meal. By the end of the chore, she is exhausted and has to sit or lie down, sometimes falling asleep wherever she happens to be.

“Anything beyond that is truly excruciating,” Ms. Wynn, 42, said.

Her heart races even during small tasks, and she often gets dizzy. At least once a month, she falls at her home outside Atlanta. Once she badly bruised her face, and another time she banged up her knee.

Ms. Wynn was infected with the coronavirus in May 2020, when she was a nurse in a hospital Covid unit, and became so ill she was put into a medically induced coma for six weeks. Ever since, her bloodwork has indicated that she is experiencing extreme inflammation, a hallmark of autoimmune disease.

Infection with the coronavirus is known to leave behind a long legacy of health problems, many of which are characterized as long Covid. But mounting evidence suggests that independent of that syndrome, the coronavirus also befuddles the immune system into targeting the body, causing autoimmune disorders in some people.

This outcome is more likely in those who, like Ms. Wynn, were severely ill with Covid, multiple studies suggest.

Covid is not unique in this aspect. Scientists have long known that infection can set the body down the path of autoimmune disease. The classic example is Epstein-Barr virus.

About one in 10 people who have mononucleosis, which is caused by the virus, go on to develop myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. A landmark study last year even linked the virus to multiple sclerosis.

Many other pathogens can also seed autoimmunity — but only in an unlucky few people.

“We are all infected with a multitude of viruses, and in the majority of cases, we don’t get any autoimmunity,” said Dr. Alberto Ascherio, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who led the multiple sclerosis study.

Infections with bacteria such as chlamydia and salmonella can inflame the joints, skin and eyes — a condition called reactive arthritis. Enteroviruses can mislead the body into attacking its own pancreatic cells, leading to Type 1 diabetes.

Like Epstein-Barr virus, dengue and H.I.V. are thought to cause autoimmunity in some people. Still, Covid seems to foment a long-term reaction that is distinct, said Dr. Timothy Henrich, a virologist at the University of California, San Francisco.

“There’s something specific about SARS-CoV-2 that seems to set it apart, in terms of the severity and duration,” he said, referring to the coronavirus.

Early in the pandemic, scientists found that antibodies that target the body instead of the pathogen — so-called autoantibodies — are important in Covid. Those who had autoantibodies to interferon, a key component of the body’s first-response system to pathogens, before they encountered the coronavirus were more likely to fare poorly or to die of Covid.

About 10 percent of patients with severe Covid, most of them men over age 55, had these antibodies, compared with just 0.3 percent in the general population.

Since then, dozens of studies have found autoantibodies in people who have had Covid. Up to half of people who have had the illness carry antibodies that can alter the immune system, damage blood vessels, impair blood pressure regulation and lead to diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and blood clots.

One study found autoantibodies in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a rare condition associated with Covid.

The autoantibodies seem to be independent of long Covid. A few studies have linked a subset of autoantibodies to long Covid, and found that their presence is one of four major risk factors for the syndrome.

But other teams have reported that the autoantibodies and long Covid don’t always accompany each other. Based on an analysis of thousands of proteins, “this autoantibody signature seems to be a Covid-related phenomenon, post-Covid and not long Covid-related,” Dr. Henrich said.

But some researchers caution that the mere presence of autoantibodies does not herald autoimmune disease.

“In every viral infection, you get autoantibodies, and this has been known for decades,” said Dr. Shiv Pillai, an immunologist at Harvard Medical School.

Many years from now, scientists may record a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases in those who had severe Covid, he said, but that is not a foregone conclusion: “There may be many, many other factors that have to be fulfilled for someone to get the disease.”

Why only some people develop autoimmune conditions is unclear, but the answer is likely to involve dozens of genes and an environmental catalyst.

Lupus is preceded by high levels of autoantibodies more than 10 years before disease onset, but many relatives of patients with lupus who have a similar genetic background never develop the disease.

“The most likely explanation is that you have all these risk factors, you have all these things ready to go, and there’s a final trigger,” said Dr. Iñaki Sanz, an immunologist at Emory University.

To conclusively link a virus to an autoimmune condition, rigorous studies would need to follow a large number of people over many years. The best example of such a study is the one that tied the Epstein-Barr virus to multiple sclerosis.

E.B.V., a member of the herpesvirus family, infects nearly everyone at some point. Once in the body, it persists forever; the virus can be reactivated by conditions including stress and hormonal changes. (Reactivation of E.B.V. is another of the four risk factors for long Covid.)

To probe its association with multiple sclerosis, Dr. Ascherio and his colleagues conducted what they call an “experiment of nature” — a long-term study of more than 10 million active-duty soldiers in the U.S. military.

Between 1993 and 2013, the researchers collected 62 million serum samples from this racially diverse group. Those who were infected with E.B.V. had a 32-fold increase in the risk of multiple sclerosis, compared with those who did not have the virus, the scientists found. They did not observe similar relationships with other viruses.

Fewer than one million Americans have multiple sclerosis, suggesting that other factors must also be involved. Still, researchers are now enthusiastic about the idea of a vaccine against E.B.V. to prevent multiple sclerosis. (No vaccines against E.B.V. are currently available, although some are in clinical trials.)

Studies from other teams support the association between E.B.V. and multiple sclerosis. Danish researchers followed more than 25,000 people with mononucleosis over decades and found that it doubled their odds of developing multiple sclerosis.

And a study published last year offered a possible explanation: E.B.V. mimics a human protein, potentially misdirecting antibodies made against the virus.

About one in four people with multiple sclerosis has these antibodies, “providing the basis for how E.B.V. could evoke an autoimmune reaction that would cause multiple sclerosis,” said Dr. William Robinson, an expert in autoimmune diseases at Stanford University who led the study.

This sort of molecular mimicry is one path to autoimmunity. But in other cases, the body may never fully clear a pathogen after infection, and the persistence of the virus — whether live virus or just remnants — may keep the body in a state of immune high alert, eventually leading to autoimmunity.

Both possibilities suggest treatments. In some small number of people, antiviral drugs and vaccination can ease the symptoms of long Covid, hinting that live virus may be the source. Dr. Henrich is conducting a study looking at monoclonal antibodies at high doses that would soak up errant viral fragments lingering in the body.

“If the viral proteins are causing an auto-reactive process, then by getting rid of those viral proteins, it might actually improve overall health,” Dr. Henrich said.

For Ms. Wynn, there is no relief in sight. She has tried a plethora of medications, including treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, but so far has not responded to them.

“It’s been a long and tedious process,” Ms. Wynn said. “And I will tell you, from a mental perspective, it has been absolutely draining.”"
"Families Fear for the Health of Ailing, Frail Israelis Held Hostage
Many of the more than 200 people seized by Hamas when it raided Israel had serious medical conditions. Some were badly injured in the attack. Doctors say they need medical care urgently.

When armed Hamas terrorists invaded her home on Oct. 7, Karina Engelbert was still recovering from a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery that had gone terribly awry. She was weak and easily fatigued, and a buildup of painful scar tissue on her chest caused tightness, limiting her mobility.

The militants kidnapped Ms. Engelbert, 51, and her entire family, including her husband, Ronen Engel, 54, and their daughters, 18-year-old Mika and 11-year-old Yuval, snatching them from the safe room inside their home on the Nir Oz kibbutz and taking them to the Gaza Strip, where they have been held for over 40 days.

“The last I heard from my sister was on that black sabbath at 9:30 in the morning, and she spoke very quietly, and she said, ‘They’re inside the house,’” Ms. Engelbert’s brother Diego Engelbert said in an interview.

He has not received any information about his sister’s condition, and she has not been visited by the International Red Cross, he said.

“We don’t know if she’s getting any medical treatment, if anyone is taking care of her, if she is getting any pain relief or any of the medication she needs to keep the cancer from coming back,” Mr. Engelbert said.Early Wednesday morning, the family members of the hostages were given the best news they had received in the more than six weeks since their loved ones were seized.

The Israeli government and Hamas announced that they would uphold a brief cease-fire in Gaza to allow for the release of at least 50 hostages. But the deal will still leave hostages behind. Ms. Engelbert is one of about 240 who were abducted from Israel, many of whom need urgent medical attention.

The Israeli government said that those who would be returned home are “women and children,” but their freedom, according to an Israeli official, would not come before Thursday at the earliest to allow time for Israeli judges to review potential legal challenges to the agreement, which calls for the release of 150 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

The hostages in Gaza range in age from infants to octogenarians, and include a Thai foreign worker who was nine months pregnant on Oct. 7 and may have given birth in captivity. There are many kibbutz members in their mid-80s who were taking medications for chronic conditions like high blood pressure, and younger adults who have both psychiatric conditions and medical conditions that can be fatal if left untreated.

And then there were those who sustained potentially life-threatening injuries in the raid itself, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, most of them civilians.

Ms. Engelbert is one of three women abducted who had breast cancer. Another was 65-year-old Yehudit Waiss, whose body was discovered by Israeli soldiers as they closed in on a hospital in Gaza last week. Israeli officials say she and Noa Marciano, a 19-year-old female soldier, were murdered by their captors. And a few days ago, Hamas said that an 86-year-old kibbutznik, Arye Zalmanovich, had died after suffering a heart attack during the Israeli bombings of Gaza.

Most elderly captives depend on medications to manage high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease, according to Hagai Levine, an Israeli physician who has been working with the families of the hostages.

Among the roughly 40 children being held, most of whom are girls, there is a 4-year-old boy whose growth is delayed and who takes a nutritional supplement because he is underweight, and the boy’s 10-month-old brother. A photo of the two redheads in the arms of their mother when they were abducted has been widely circulated.

Some hostages now being held by Hamas were shot, beaten or otherwise wounded during the attack.

Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old American citizen, lost a hand to a grenade, gunfire or both, his family says. The redheaded children’s father, Yarden Bibas, was beaten on the head with a hammer, videos circulated by the militants show. Guy Iluz, 26, was shot, according to his mother, Doris Liber, who traveled from Israel to Capitol Hill to plead for help.

“They all need medical attention,” Dr. Levine said in an interview. “They are being held underground, without enough food and water, and with unceasing trauma, for more than 40 days. Even a minor injury could trigger an infection that could become life-threatening.”

Families of the hostages have demanded that the International Committee of the Red Cross, or I.C.R.C., be allowed to visit their relatives and tend to the wounded and the sick, as guaranteed under the provisions of the Geneva Convention. So far, that has not happened.

Red Cross officials say that the organization has been advocating on behalf of the hostages in Gaza, speaking both directly with Hamas and with other parties that may have influence on Hamas. So far, however, the Red Cross has been unable to visit them to check on their health or deliver medications, a spokeswoman said.

“The I.C.R.C. cannot force its way in to where hostages are held,” said Alyona Synenko, a Jerusalem-based spokeswoman for the organization. “We can only visit them when agreements, including safe access, are in place.”

Relatives of the hostages have campaigned relentlessly for their release, traveling around the world to meet with foreign officials, speaking with the media, addressing the United Nations, writing guest essays in newspapers and holding daily demonstrations in the newly named Hostages Square in front of the Tel Aviv Museum.

On Saturday, families of hostages and thousands of their supporters concluded a five-day march to Jerusalem, where they plan to press the government to obtain the release of the captives. Many are furious with the Israeli government — and with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in particular — both about the failures that led to the Hamas incursion and the lack of support and regular communication with relatives about the status of hostage negotiations.

“We want the government to do everything possible to bring the hostages back — that has to be the top priority,” Tomer Keshet, Mr. Bibas’s cousin, said in an interview. “Yarden is wounded, and the baby isn’t even standing yet, he is barely crawling.”

“We are so worried that the children were separated from their parents, that they are frightened, that they don’t have the right things to eat, and that that could have long-term repercussions,” Mr. Keshet said. “They are being held underground, hungry, not knowing what’s going on, hearing bombing and fighting and shouting in a language they don’t understand. We don’t know what condition they are in, or what condition they will be in when they come back, after this emotional trauma.”

Although physicians generally refrain from discussing their patients’ medical conditions out of respect for privacy, several personal physicians of the hostages spoke out publicly last week to draw attention to their plight and stress the urgency of their situation.

“In some cases, children were taken moments after watching their parents being brutally murdered,” said Dr. Zion Hagai, chairman of the Israel Medical Association. “They are not only forced to live with this trauma but to experience it in a strange, dark and scary place.”

Speakers highlighted the cases of several particularly vulnerable hostages, among them Raz Ben Ami, 57, from the Be’eri kibbutz, who was being treated for neurosarcoidosis, a serious and rare disease that affects the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves, causing hearing and vision loss, confusion, agitation and other effects.

Dr. Arnon Elizur spoke of a young  patient, Yagil Yaakov, who has a life-threatening peanut allergy and could die in minutes if he were exposed to even trace amounts of peanut powder. Islamic Jihad, another militant group in the Gaza Strip, recently published a video of the boy, looking pale and thin, with dark shadows under his eyes.

“I can’t imagine what is going through his mind when he is served food,” Dr. Elizur said. “Can he be certain it doesn’t contain trace amounts of peanuts? Every meal for him is like playing Russian roulette.”

The son of another  hostage, Haim Peri, said that his father  had advanced heart disease.

“He is an artist, a peace activist and a man who always fought for human rights,” said the son, Noam Peri. “He is a brave man, but at age 80, he is not a healthy man, and requires daily medications. He will not survive captivity for long.”"
"Was This a Recurrence of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma or Something Else?
“Go to the emergency room,” the doctor told him after hearing of his trip and fever, rash and whole-body weakness. “You need to be seen.”

The 57-year-old man looked up the long staircase that led to his rooms in the rectory, the residence he shared with three other priests. He gripped the handrail on either side of the stairs and forced his foot onto the first step. Slowly he pulled himself up the two flights of stairs to his rooms. His trip home to Boston from a conference in Asunción, Paraguay, had been rough. It was an overnight trip, but he hadn’t been able to sleep at all. Now all he wanted to do was take off his Roman collar and lie down.

When he finally made it to his rooms, he looked into his bathroom mirror. His face was bright red and shiny with sweat. The red continued down his chest and onto his belly. His whole body ached. He crawled gratefully beneath his covers. What he really needed was a good night’s sleep, he told himself. But as sleep continued to elude him, he suddenly felt cold. He shivered uncontrollably. The shaking chills confirmed what he already suspected: He was sick. And that worried him.

Six years earlier he felt this bad after a flight. He went to the hospital and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Treatment had been brutal. The seven months of chemotherapy killed the cancer but also destroyed his body’s ability to make any blood for himself. He was rescued with stem cells — the cells that create the blood he needed — harvested from his own body before he started the treatment. He had been disease-free since then but knew that recurrence was possible. It was a low-level anxiety he faced with every subsequent symptom. Before the cancer, he might have just toughed it out. Not now.

He called Dr. Peter Zuromskis, his longtime primary care physician. He hated to bother him on a Saturday, but he thought this was important enough to merit the call. “Go to the emergency room,” the doctor told him after hearing of his trip and fever, rash and whole-body weakness. “You need to be seen.”

Trouble Carrying His Suitcase
One of his housemates drove him to the emergency department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. It was dark outside by the time he passed through the busy E.D. and into a room in the hospital. He repeated his story a half-dozen times to various doctors, nurses and trainees as he was poked, prodded, stuck and imaged for hours. The priest was grateful for the quiet of the small room where he was finally able to rest.

Dr. Martin Kaminski was the hospitalist on the night shift. He introduced himself and asked the patient to tell his story, listening as the man described his trip, his weakness, his rash, his fever. His temperature was 102 when he arrived at the hospital but had come down with acetaminophen and IV fluids. When the patient got to the end, Kaminski had a few more questions. Had he used insect repellent while in South America? No, the priest recalled. A fellow priest gave him a wristband that was supposed to keep the mosquitoes away. He hadn’t felt any bites while there. He drank only bottled water, he added. Did he leave the city or go for hikes in wooded areas? Had he been in contact with any domestic or farm animals? No, he was too busy to leave the hotel where the conference was held.

Kaminski asked if he had any body aches. He did. And earlier, his right hand felt achy and a little weak. He had trouble carrying his suitcase. On the ride home, his neck felt strangely weak, as if his head had suddenly gotten much heavier. His neck still felt sore and stiff. The doctor asked him if he could put his chin on his chest. A stiff neck could suggest meningitis. But the patient demonstrated that he could. He was worried, the priest told Kaminski. He had felt this sick only once in his life — and that time was diagnosed with lymphoma. Could it have come back? In the E.D., the hematology-oncology team recommended a CT scan of his chest, abdomen and pelvis, but he hadn’t had it yet. Kaminski told the anxious man that he thought an infection was much more likely than cancer. But they would know more after the CT scan.

A Bite on His Ankle?
As he examined the priest, Kaminski noted that his rash was on his back and arms as well as his chest. It looked like a sunburn, and the red skin paled to near-white when Kaminski pressed his finger into the bright-colored skin on his chest, indicating that it was some kind of inflammation in the skin rather than blood leaking from the vessels below it. There was a tender red nodule on his ankle — possibly a bite. Otherwise, his exam was unremarkable. The lymph nodes in his neck and groin and those under his arms were not enlarged. If he had lymphoma, it wasn’t obvious. Infection was still the most likely cause of his misery.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the doctor told the priest, there was an outbreak of chikungunya fever — a viral infection spread by mosquitoes — in Paraguay. And most of the cases had been reported where he’d been, in Asunción. The disease usually isn’t fatal but can cause an arthritis that can last months or even years after the infection is gone.

Of course, there were other possibilities, Kaminski added. It could be dengue, another viral disease — spread by the same mosquito. Dengue can cause high fevers and body aches so severe the illness is called breakbone fever. And it can be deadly. While patients infected the first time are often just miserable, those unlucky enough to catch it a second time are at risk of developing a hemorrhagic version of the infection. Each infection is common throughout South America. Each is a virus, spread by the same mosquito. Chikungunya is famous for its abrupt onset and short incubation period, and so that was first on his list. Another possibility was that it was something he caught before he left his home in the Northeast. Maybe some tick-borne disease — like Lyme or anaplasmosis. They should have the answer within the week.

Lingering Aches and Fatigue
The patient felt better by the next day and was eager to go home. The fever and weakness were gone, and the rash was fading. Only the achiness remained. His doctors still weren’t sure what he had. The only thing known at that point was that this was not a recurrence of his lymphoma. The CT scan showed a couple of enlarged lymph nodes in his chest, but the radiologist thought those were most consistent with an infection. The scans of his abdomen and pelvis, where his original cancer had been located, looked fine.

In the days after the priest’s discharge, Kaminski watched as the test results came back. The test for chikungunya was negative. So was the test for dengue. It wasn’t any of the other diseases that he and the infectious-disease doctors had looked for.

As for the patient, although the fever was gone by the time he left the hospital, the fatigue and body aches hung on. His head felt cloudy; even reading was hard. Over the following weeks he felt better, but not well. He went to see Zuromskis and described his persistent malaise. What else could this be? Zuromskis smiled. He was confident this was chikungunya. But the test was negative, the patient reminded him. “That test was negative then,” he replied. If he repeated the test now, the doctor felt certain it would be positive.

Those first results showed the priest’s immune response to each of the infections they looked for. If he had ever been exposed to that bug before, the test looking for the antibody would read positive immediately; the template to fight off that bug would have already been made by his immune system and stored away. If, instead, this was a first infection, it would take days for the body to gear up and create the bespoke antibodies, tailored to this specific invader. It might have been negative while he was in the hospital, but Zuromskis was sure it wouldn’t be negative now. He sent the tests for the suspected viruses. The results came back a few days later. Only one was positive. Very positive. He had chikungunya fever.

The trip to Paraguay was eight months ago. Full recovery was slow. The stiffness and joint pains lasted for months. It’s only recently that he has been able to take on the stairs with his old vigor and speed. And yet, despite the infection and his history of cancer, he is, he tells me, a healthy man.

"Why We’re Still Breathing Dirty Indoor Air
The pandemic and recent wildfires have shown how unhealthy indoor air can be. But scientific and governmental inertia have slowed the necessary remedies.

In early 2020, the world scrubbed down surfaces, washed hands and sneezed into elbows, desperate to avoid infection with a new coronavirus. But the threat was not really lying on countertops and doorknobs.

The virus was wafting through the air, set adrift in coughs and conversation, even in song. The pandemic raged for six months before global health authorities acknowledged that it was driven by an airborne pathogen.

With that revelation came another: Had indoor air quality ever been a priority, the pandemic would have exacted a far lighter toll in the United States.

More than three years later, little has changed. Most Americans are still squeezing into offices, classrooms, restaurants and shops with inadequate, often decrepit ventilation systems, often in buildings with windows sealed shut.

Scientists agree that the next pandemic will almost certainly arise from another airborne virus. But improving air quality isn’t just about fighting infectious diseases: Indoor pollution can damage the heart, lungs and brain, shortening life spans and lowering cognition.

And wildfires, outdoor air pollution and climate change will quickly preclude Band-Aid solutions, like simply opening windows or pumping in more air from outside.

Instead, the nation will have to begin to think about the indoor air — in schools, restaurants, offices, trains, airports, movie theaters — as an environment that greatly influences human health. Improving it will require money, scientific guidance on how clean the air needs to be and, most crucially, political will to compel change.

“The push for clean water is considered one of the 10 biggest public health advances of the last century, and air should be no different,” said Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne transmission of viruses at Virginia Tech.

Federal and state laws govern the quality of water, food and outdoor pollution, but there are no regulations for indoor air quality overall, only scattershot limits on a few pollutants. Nor does any single federal agency or official champion the cause.

Without building codes or laws to enforce them, efforts to address air quality have so far been patchy. Some cities, school districts and businesses have forged ahead on their own. But by and large, Americans are still breathing the indoor air that set the stage for the pandemic.

“Everyone just does the minimum,” said Shelly Miller, an aerosol expert at the University of Colorado Boulder.

The real obstacle now, experts said in interviews, is the lack of leadership — a federal agency or even a ventilation czar to enforce recommendations and set the nation on a long-needed course to improve indoor air quality.

“To achieve real change that reaches a broad swath of the population,” Dr. Marr said, “we need standards to be incorporated into building codes and laws at the state and federal level.”

Two new sets of recommendations may begin to usher in change. In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended five so-called air changes per hour — the equivalent of replacing all the air in a room — in all buildings, including schools.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, an association of air quality experts, went further, proposing a recommendation of more than eight air changes.

Both sets of guidelines also offer clarity on air quality monitors and upgrades to air filters and ventilation systems.

“It’s a huge leap,” Dr. Marr said, “because it’s the first time, outside of hospitals and specialized workplaces, we have seen some kind of indoor air target that is based on health rather than just thermal comfort or energy considerations.”

A Paradigm Shift

Indoor air quality might have taken center stage sooner if the medical establishment had not firmly believed that respiratory diseases like influenza spread almost exclusively through large respiratory droplets that are expelled when a person coughs or sneezes.

The idea may have been fueled by observations that people who were closest to a sick person seemed most at risk of infection. That led medical experts to recommend hand washing and social distancing as the best ways to contain a respiratory virus.

But scientists showed decades ago that large droplets may evaporate and shrink as they are expelled, becoming tiny aerosols that linger in the air. That is, a patient with the flu isn’t just expelling the virus in large droplets. According to Yuguo Li, an air quality expert at the University of Hong Kong, that patient may exhale, cough or sneeze droplets in any number of sizes.

The smallest will drift through the air and be inhaled directly into the lungs — a scenario that requires precautions far different than wiping down surfaces or washing hands.

To Dr. Li and other air quality experts, it was obvious from the start of the pandemic that the coronavirus was carried aloft. The SARS coronavirus, a close relative that emerged in Asia in 2002, was airborne — why would the new one be any different?

In January 2020, Chinese researchers described a cluster of infections that included a 10-year-old child who had no symptoms but whose scans revealed “ground-glass lung opacities,” a sign of infection with the new coronavirus.

Dr. Donald K. Milton of the University of Maryland, who has studied respiratory virus transmission for decades, knew what that meant: The coronavirus was being inhaled into the lungs.

“If an asymptomatic kid can have that going on in his lungs, it’s going to be very difficult to contain, because asymptomatic people are going to be contagious,” Dr. Milton recalled thinking when the Chinese report came out.

Other evidence for airborne transmission quickly piled up. There was a New York man who became infected simply by driving his neighbor to the hospital, the 712 infected passengers and crew members of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, a choir practice in Seattle, and diners at a restaurant in China.

Still, the erroneous distinction between large and small droplets remained entrenched, despite attempts from physicists and air quality experts to set the record straight.

“The resistance was thick. The walls of the silo were thick,” said Richard Corsi, dean of the College of Engineering at the University of California, Davis. “I’ll be blunt, it’s been frustrating as hell from the very start.”

Some scientists felt the health agencies were stonewalling because the consequences of indoor aerosol transmission — high-quality masks, air filtration, building closures — would require a herculean response.

William Bahnfleth, an architectural engineering expert at Penn State University, said he was shocked by “the paralysis of the public health community, the demand for more and more conclusive data.”

It took the C.D.C. until April 2020 to recommend masking and until October 2020 to acknowledge aerosol transmission of the coronavirus, and even then only obliquely. The World Health Organization was forced to review its stance in July 2020, after 239 experts issued a statement demanding it.

A watershed moment came in the spring of 2021, when three major medical journals published papers on airborne transmission of the coronavirus.

Still, the W.H.O. did not use the word “airborne” to describe the virus until December 2021, and the C.D.C. has yet to do so.

“I worked with them on editing the scientific brief on transmission, and it was clear that they did not want to use the word,” Dr. Marr said of the C.D.C. “It’s maddening.”

‘Health and Happiness’
Respiratory viruses aren’t the only reason to clean the air indoors.

Indoor air pollution — from wildfire smoke that infiltrates homes, building materials like asbestos, gases like radon or even fumes from cleaning supplies — affects the heart, lungs and the brain, contributing to chronic illnesses like asthma and diabetes.

Elevated carbon dioxide in crowded rooms can cause drowsiness and loss of concentration, leading to poor academic performance. Improved air quality can reduce absenteeism, in schools and in offices.

“Improving indoor air quality pays for itself, in benefits to both the economy and to human health and happiness,” said Brian Fleck, an air quality expert at the University of Alberta in Canada. “It’s always surprising how things known for a very long time are still not acted upon.”

As the pandemic unfolded, some schools and businesses coped by simply opening windows. But with wildfires, soaring temperatures and rising air pollution, that will cease to be a practical option — indeed, it already has in many parts of the world.

The better solution is to clean the air already indoors.

Experts generally agree that the air in a room should be replaced six to eight times an hour. For an average-size room, air purifiers that cost a few hundred dollars can accomplish that goal.

Some schools have even successfully turned to homemade $100 contraptions of box fans that are taped to air filters. Ultraviolet light is an energy-efficient and powerful way to kill pathogens, and there are newer versions that are not harmful to people.

But a far-reaching campaign to clean America’s indoor air has not yet happened. In California, the minimum recommended standard is six changes per hour. But in one study, 93 percent of schools fell below that standard.

It’s not that there has been no discussion of fresh air.

The Biden administration’s pandemic preparedness plan, published in September 2021, included support of new technology to provide “pathogen protection within the built environment” and investments for retrofitting older buildings.

In March 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency announced the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, which includes a checklist for better ventilation, to encourage building administrators to take air quality seriously. And in October 2022, the White House held a summit on indoor air quality, calling on business and school leaders to make improvements to mitigate the spread of Covid.

A life sciences team within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy — the first under any administration — is coordinating efforts to improve indoor air quality with various arms of the government.

But none of these efforts has yet coalesced into anything like a rigorous national plan.

For once, money does not appear to be the barrier. The American Rescue Plan allotted $350 billion to state and local governments for Covid-related expenses, including measures to improve air quality. Schools can tap another $200 billion from various programs instituted during the pandemic.

For private businesses, even an investment of just $40 per employee could save about $7,000 per person per year, according to Joseph Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

But widespread change is unlikely unless a federal agency or official is tasked with establishing and enforcing standards, many scientists believe.

“The problem is there’s no regulatory authority to make this happen on the federal level,” said David Michaels, who led the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under President Barack Obama.

The E.P.A. has authority over outdoor air and specific pollutants like asbestos, lead and radon. OSHA has no rules on airborne infections, and an attempt in the 1990s to regulate air quality was quickly quashed by the tobacco industry.

The C.D.C. can offer recommendations on indoor air but not rules, and it does not venture far into ventilation practices and standards.

Still, the agency’s new guidelines may make it easier for people and businesses to recognize and demand better air quality. At least in theory, they may also enable OSHA to hold employers responsible for maintaining clean air, Dr. Michaels said.

“It helps OSHA if they want to directly address particular problems now, but it’s sort of a road map to future indoor air quality standards,” he said.

Dr. Allen noted that the move toward clean water came in fits and starts over decades, and changes to ventilation, too, may take a long time to unspool.

“The next pandemic, whatever it is, buildings will be part of the core response on Day 1,” he said. “I don’t have any doubt about that.”"
"What to Know About Assisted Living
The facilities can look like luxury apartments or modest group homes, and can vary in pricing structures. Here’s a guide.

Are you confused about what an assisted-living facility is, and how it differs from a nursing home? And what you can expect to pay? Here’s a guide to this type of housing for older people.

What is assisted living?
Assisted-living facilities occupy the middle ground of housing for people who can no longer live independently but don’t need the full-time medical supervision provided at a nursing home. They might be right for those who have trouble moving about, bathing, eating or dressing, or who have Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia.

Assisted-living facilities can look like luxury apartments or modest group homes, but they are staffed with aides who can help residents take a shower, get out of bed, get to the dining room, take medications, or help with other daily tasks and needs. Meals, activities and housekeeping are usually provided. Some facilities have trained nurses on-site, but in many states the facilities are not required to have them at the ready, or at all. Popular buildings — or specialized units within them, such as ones for dementia — have waiting lists.

“The key is to start early,” said Eilon Caspi, an assistant research professor at the University of Connecticut. “You don’t want to wait for the crisis and then have 24 hours to make a decision.”

How can I know how much assisted living will cost me?
The monthly costs to live in a facility generally range from $3,000 to $12,000 or more. Charges are frequently broken into two components: rent and a care plan. Rents are set similarly to the way landlords establish them for apartments, with larger units in more expensive regions having higher rents and rent concessions more likely when many units are unoccupied.

The costs of care plans are based on how much assistance the facility thinks residents will need, at least when they first move in. Most of them assign residents a “level” or “tier” based on the extent of their needs, but some will itemize charges for specific services. It’s like the difference between a prix fixe and an à la carte menu (except you don’t get to choose which approach you prefer within each facility). Assisted-living units or facilities devoted to dementia residents are more likely to set one comprehensive price, though many have tiers.

Make sure the facility’s assessment reflects what the resident will need, or it might increase the price if it is providing more assistance than expected. Check if meals are priced separately.

What charges may catch me by surprise?
Facilities often have nonrecurring initial charges, like move-in fees or “community fees.” You should ask whether there are extra charges for things residents might need or use, like nurse visits, cable television or other kinds of assistance: Such charges can pile up quickly if they’re not detailed as included in the care plan. Some places even charge more if you get medications from a pharmacy other than the one they have a business relationship with.

It’s worth checking a few months after moving in to see if the care plan is more than the resident needs. If so, ask for the price to be lowered to remove services that aren’t being used.

Is it better to go with a facility that charges a set monthly amount or one that bills for each service?
If you want predictability in your monthly bill, you’re safer with a facility that is all-inclusive or that charges by tiers or bundled services. That’s also true if you need assistance with many things. If you don’t need a lot of help, à la carte may be better. Some facilities have an independent living wing or a program with à la carte pricing, which may be best for those who need only sporadic assistance. If you need more help as time goes on, you can transition to the assisted-living section or program and get a care bundle.

What happens when a resident ages and becomes frailer?
Care plans for those needing the most assistance can be double or triple the cost of those for the most independent residents. Ask the facility to explain what causes price increases. Be honest with yourself, and the facility, about what you can afford when the bill rises, because it’s going to. “You’ve got to understand your future is coming,” said Karen Van Dyke, a certified senior adviser in San Diego who helps families find the right facility for them.

Also make sure you understand the maximum level of care the place can provide. If you require more, the home may make you move out. For instance, some places will care for people who have occasional lapses of memory or disorientation but not those whose dementia causes delusions, agitation or aggression. There are fewer legal protections against evictions in assisted-living facilities than in nursing homes. Be realistic about what you need: No one wants to move into a nursing home, but it’s dangerous for residents to stay in an assisted-living facility that can’t take care of them.

What happens if I run out of money?
You may have to leave. Most assisted-living facilities are for-profit, and they have no legal obligation to keep the indigent. About one in five facilities accepts Medicaid to help pay for the cost of providing care, but Medicaid doesn’t cover rent at assisted-living facilities, so even then you may be forced out. Some states or counties will help cover the cost of housing if you have no savings and little retirement income, so it’s worth finding out if that’s available. (Call your local Area Agency on Aging for assistance.) Some facility owners will accept lower fees for longtime residents, but they are the exception.

How can I find out how good a facility is?
While it’s easy to get wowed by fancy dining options, sparkly chandeliers and other building amenities, none of those are markers of quality care. If you’re considering multiple facilities, ask about the ratio of residents to aides — on nights and weekends as well as days — and whether there are licensed nurses in the building, and when they are there.

The person running the facility is often known as the administrator or director. Ask about how often this position has turned over. If a facility has churned through several administrators in a few years, that’s a troubling sign about the quality of its management and owners.

Which are better — nonprofit or for-profit assisted-living facilities?
Researchers have found that for-profit facilities in Minnesota and Florida are more likely to be cited for violating state health regulations, but there’s not solid evidence nationwide. There are good and bad facilities of both ownership types: A small for-profit residence with an engaged owner on site may provide better care than a mediocre nonprofit. Be aware that nonprofits generally aren’t less expensive than for-profits: While they don’t have to provide returns to investors, they do run like a business and need to earn more than they spend each month for capital improvements and to avoid cash flow problems. Nonprofits often use the same pricing methods as for-profits, and many charge more.

What should I look for during a tour?
Kristine Sundberg, executive director of Elder Voice Advocates in Minnesota, a coalition of family members, tells people to watch how residents engage with a facility’s workers. “Are they active and busy with things, or are they slouched over in a chair, being ignored?” she said. You might aim to visit on weekends, when staffing is often lightest. Ask the facility if it will let families put cameras in residents’ rooms so you can keep tabs on them remotely.

Who can help me?
Along with consumer groups like Ms. Sundberg’s, some of the most knowledgeable independent experts are long-term care ombudsmen, who are federally funded advocates for residents of nursing homes and other facilities for older people. Every state has such a program with advocates assigned to particular regions. An Area Agency on Aging is another source. These agencies are local government or nonprofit organizations that each state designates to help older people. They can help you understand your financial options and find facilities. You can locate your agency via https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/Index.aspx.

If you want to check out a facility’s history of infractions, find the state agency that licenses assisted-living facilities. In some states, it’s part of the health department, while others assign this job to their human service or social service agency. A report is written up after a facility is inspected. Licensing agencies may publish inspection reports on their websites, although they aren’t always easy to find. It’s a red flag if a facility is repeatedly cited for the same problem."
"A Simple Way to Save Premature Babies

Shortly after a baby is born, doctors clamp the umbilical cord linking the infant to the placenta, which is still inside the mother’s uterus, and then cut it. New research shows that if doctors wait at least two minutes after the birth to clamp the cord, they significantly improve in-hospital survival rates for premature infants.

Delayed cord clamping — an intervention that can be introduced at relatively little cost — is believed to help because it allows umbilical cord blood, which is rich in iron, stem cells and antibodies, to flow back to the baby. Some experts say that it’s not entirely clear why the strategy seems to help, but that the data is convincing.

How It Works: Doctors wait to cut the cord.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already recommends delaying clamping by 30 to 60 seconds for both full-term and preterm newborns.

Preterm babies are those born before 37 weeks of gestation. In preterm infants, delayed clamping leads to improved circulation, less need for blood transfusions and a lower incidence of serious complications, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, or inflammation of the digestive tract.

The evidence about whether the practice is beneficial for them has been inconsistent, according to Anna Lene Seidler, lead author of two new review papers and a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney in Australia.

The new research also sought to determine the optimal time to wait before clamping. The longest delays that were studied were three minutes after birth.

“We found that the longer we wait, the better, and the more we can reduce mortality,” Dr. Seidler said. “We were astounded by how consistent the findings are.”

Two new papers, published in The Lancet, analyzed dozens of studies involving thousands of babies born in hospitals in a range of countries, including Britain, India, Iran and the United States.

The Numbers: A two-minute postponement seems optimal.
One of the reviews compared the effectiveness of three techniques: immediate cord clamping, deferred clamping and milking an intact umbilical cord so that more blood flowed to the newborn.

The paper examined 48 randomized trials and analyzed data on 6,367 infants, finding that delayed cord clamping reduced in-hospital deaths of preterm newborns by one-third, compared with immediate cord clamping. There were no statistically significant differences between any other interventions.

A second review and meta-analysis, which included data from 47 trials with 6,094 participants, compared umbilical cord milking with immediate clamping less than 45 seconds after birth, between 45 seconds and up to 120 seconds after birth, and two minutes or more after birth.

The analysis found that the longest deferral of clamping increased survival the most, compared with immediate clamping. But the authors noted that if the newborn required immediate resuscitation, the cord should be kept intact only as long as resuscitation can be provided at the same time.

Why It Matters: Delayed clamping can be quickly implemented.
Worldwide, some 13 million premature babies are born every year, and almost a million of them die within a month of birth. A low-cost, low-tech intervention like delayed cord clamping has the potential to save many lives.

Preterm births are an enormous problem in the United States, where one in 10 infants is born prematurely. Rates are higher among Black and Native American babies than among white and Hispanic babies.

Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of death among American infants. Infant mortality rates rose last year for the first time in decades, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Deaths are more common among Black babies.

But implementing a change in guidelines to delay clamping the umbilical cord for two minutes or more may be complicated. Many preterm babies in the United States are born by cesarean section and require resuscitation.

A delay might mean that the necessary equipment has to be brought into the operating room even though it should be kept in a sterile environment, like a neonatal intensive care unit, said Dr. Anup Katheria, director of neonatal research at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns in San Diego.

“I don’t think we know the full ramifications a change in guidelines could entail,” Dr. Katheria said. “But if it really reduces the risk of death, why would you cut the cord?”

"Sickle-Cell Treatment Created With Gene Editing Wins U.K. Approval
The first treatment that relies on CRISPR is expected to receive U.S. approval next month. But it may cost millions of dollars per patient.

Regulators in Britain on Thursday approved the first treatment derived from CRISPR, the revolutionary gene-editing method. Called Casgevy, the treatment is intended to cure sickle-cell disease and a related condition, beta thalassemia.

The manufacturers, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, based in Boston, and CRISPR Therapeutics, based in Switzerland, say about 2,000 patients in Britain with sickle-cell disease or beta thalassemia are expected to be eligible for the treatment.

The companies anticipate that the Food and Drug Administration will approve Casgevy for sickle-cell patients in the United States in early December. The agency will decide on approval for beta thalassemia next year.

In late December, the F.D.A. is expected to approve another sickle cell gene therapy by Bluebird Bio of Somerville, Mass. That treatment does not rely on gene editing, instead using a method that inserts new DNA into the genome.

Sickle-cell disease is caused by a defective gene that leads to the creation of abnormal hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component in red blood cells. The cells themselves become malformed, causing episodes of extreme pain. About 100,000 Americans, who are mostly Black and Hispanic, are believed to have the illness.

Understand Sickle Cell Disease
The rare blood disorder, which can cause debilitating pain, strokes and organ failure, affects 100,000 Americans and millions of people globally, mostly in Africa.
 A New Hope: The F.D.A. approves new therapies for the disease, including one that uses CRISPR, but the obstacles to treatments are myriad.
 On the Edge of Fear: Only a small fraction of patients are expected to receive one of these treatments for the disease, which in the United States mostly affects Black people.
Preventing Complications: A legacy of neglect toward Americans with the disease means that patients may not receive the treatments needed to stave off the disease’s risks.
The Global Epicenter: In Nigeria, where 150,000 babies are born each year with sickle cell disease, the effects of the condition are pervasive and devastating.

In beta thalassemia, the defective gene leads to deficient levels of hemoglobin in red blood cells. The condition is rare.

Casgevy relies on CRISPR to nick the DNA, activating a gene that produces an alternative form of hemoglobin. To receive the sickle-cell treatment, patients in Britain must be at least 12 years old and have experienced repeated episodes of extreme pain.

There is no upper age limit, nor are patients excluded because they have suffered too much organ damage from sickle-cell disease, said Dr. David Altshuler, Vertex’s chief scientific officer.

But the patients must have no other options. Sickle-cell disease can be cured with a bone-marrow transplant, but few patients have compatible donors.

For people struggling with the illness, the Vertex and Bluebird treatments have been a long time coming. Pain is not the only complication — people with sickle-cell disease also suffer bone and organ damage and strokes. The misshapen blood cells do not survive long, resulting in anemia.

Still, the CRISPR and Bluebird treatments are onerous and will require expertise that most hospitals lack.

Patients must receive intense chemotherapy to clear their bone marrow of abnormal stem cells and make room for the genetically altered cells. Then the patients must stay a month or more in a hospital while their marrow regrows.

And gene editing is expensive. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics have not set a price yet in Britain — that will depend on conversations with those who will be paying for it, said Stuart Arbuckle, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Vertex.

The price in the United States, though, is expected to be millions of dollars per patient. Sickle-cell disease itself is expensive, however, costing the U.S. health system an estimated $3 billion a year.

In the United States, Bluebird already has a gene therapy approved for beta thalassemia. It costs $2.8 million per patient.

Dr. Altshuler said Vertex was testing its sickle-cell treatment in children ages 5 to 11, hoping to prevent the irreversible organ damage that occurs over time.

The company’s first sickle-cell patient, Victoria Gray, said on Thursday that the treatment changed her life.

Ms. Gray, a Walmart associate in Forest, Miss., was diagnosed with sickle-cell disease when she was 3 months old and had a pain crisis. Those episodes became a part of her life, resulting in frequent hospitalizations.

“A lot of my dreams, I couldn’t do,” she said. “The smallest things — cold, changing weather — I would end up in the hospital.”

She had the gene editing treatment in 2019, when she was 33. Now, she said, all her symptoms have vanished.

“It meant a new beginning,” Ms. Gray said. “It is more than I ever dreamed of, for everything to be gone.”"
"Why Some Seniors Are Choosing Pot Over Pills
Older people are using cannabis more than ever. Here’s what to know about its potential medicinal benefits and side effects as we age.

Seniors are one of the fastest-growing populations of cannabis users in the United States. While some older adults have used pot for decades, studies suggest that others are turning to the drug for the first time to help them sleep better, dampen pain or treat anxiety — especially when prescription drugs, which often come with unwanted side effects, don’t work as intended.

In 2007, only about 0.4 percent of people age 65 and older in the United States had reported using cannabis in the past year, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. That number rose to almost 3 percent by 2016. As of 2022, it was at more than 8 percent.

Nancy Herring, 76, has been using cannabis recreationally for her entire adult life — she describes herself as “one of the hippies from the ’60s.” But it wasn’t until her husband was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and dementia two years ago that she began to wonder about pot’s medicinal use.

During the course of his illness, her husband, now 79, had developed insomnia. Soon, neither of them was sleeping.

Doctors prescribed pills to help him rest, but “nothing really worked,” she said. At one point, he reacted so negatively to a medicine he ended up in the hospital.

Then they tried an indica strain from a dispensary near where they live in Clearwater, Fla. Now, after one gummy and a hit on a pipe, her husband “can sleep at night, which is a huge thing,” she said.

Marijuana’s medicinal properties have not been well studied, particularly among older users, making it difficult for doctors to counsel their patients on the benefits and risks. Cannabis companies have rushed to fill the void, offering tips to older adults about doses or formulations and even creating products meant to appeal to them. Meanwhile, as more seniors experiment with cannabis, they are evangelizing to one another about its benefits, and sharing the problems they’ve encountered along the way.

“People are just desperate,” said Dr. Aaron Greenstein, a geriatric psychiatrist in Denver. “They’re willing to try anything.”

When his own grandmother became convinced that she was reliving the Holocaust during the later stages of her dementia, taking a dissolvable strip with a small amount of THC — the psychoactive component in marijuana — put an end to her flashbacks and helped her feel at peace.

“I have had dozens of patients who tell me that it has cured their various ailments,” said Dr. Haley V. Solomon, a geriatric psychiatrist in San Diego who, along with Dr. Greenstein, has written about the promise and risks of seniors using cannabis. “I think that it’s really important to listen to them, to acknowledge that and then to study it further.”

Older adults need to be aware of potential drug interactions, she added, and also consider how cannabis can affect cognition, coordination and balance.

‘Medicine isn’t working.’
Without a North Star guiding older adults on how to use cannabis, there is a grass-roots effort among some seniors to teach one another.

Carminetta Verner, 88, has become the go-to source for cannabis information at her retirement community, the sprawling Leisure World complex in Montgomery County, Md., which houses about 8,000 older adults.

More About Cannabis
With recreational marijuana becoming legal in several states, cannabis products are becoming more easily available and increasingly varied.
Marijuana or a Gun?: Legal challenges are pending across the country against a federal law that prevents medical marijuana users from buying or owning firearms.
Use Among Older Adults: Older people are using cannabis more than ever. Here’s what to know about the potential medicinal benefits and the side effects.
In Limbo: Since New York legalized marijuana two and a half years ago, its effort to set up the industry has been a slow and bumpy ride. Here’s why.
Federal Recruiters Relax Rules: As more states legalize marijuana and competition for talent grows fiercer, the U.S. government is loosening hiring rules from the “Just Say No” era.
In 2018, she founded a club devoted to educating residents about medical cannabis. The club’s membership, which has now grown to about 100 people, might be higher if it weren’t for the stigma still associated with the drug, Ms. Verner said.

“There are a lot of people up here that are suffering and in pain, and medicine isn’t working for them,” she said.

Damien Cornwell, the owner of a dispensary in Binghamton, N.Y., that opened in February, said his business has attracted customers who are “seeking relief they can’t find at the doctor’s office.” They have ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety and insomnia, he said.

As more states legalize cannabis — it is now permitted for recreational use in more than 20 states and Washington, D.C., and for medical use in 38 states and D.C. — the number of seniors who turn to marijuana will only continue to grow, experts said. An October Gallup poll found that about two-thirds of adults 55 and older think the use of marijuana should be legal.

Cannabis brands are courting seniors.
Steve Hickerson, who lives in Laguna Woods, Calif., wants to sleep better.

He used cannabis sublingual drops but said they didn’t help, so he’s trying gummies, “which seem to work much better.” In the past, he felt using mind-altering drugs was morally wrong — “I’m a Christian,” he explained — but now, he said, “I’m 79, things are different.” He is willing to explore products that have a medical use.

Companies are capitalizing on the newfound interest. Earlier this year, Mr. Hickerson was bused to an event organized by Glass House, one of the biggest cannabis brands in the country, along with about 50 other people from his retirement community who were offered cannabis products at a substantial discount.

The company Trulieve, which has the largest retail footprint for cannabis products in the United States and a 750,000-square-foot cannabis cultivation facility in north Florida, is also connecting with older people through educational sessions at senior living communities.

Kim Rivers, the co-founder and chief executive of Trulieve, said their “wisdom” customers — those 55 and older — are growing year over year. In Florida, she added, these adults represent 20 percent of their customer base.

Bristol Extracts, which manufactures cannabis in New York, has created a brand called Senior Moments — a collection of tinctures, gummies and mints that debuted in March.

“IT’S TIME TO SPICE THINGS UP A LITTLE!” proclaims the company’s website. “Growing older doesn’t have to be mundane.”

The brand’s edibles also have ingredients like ginkgo biloba that are advertised as supporting “memory and mood.” Soon the line will include body balms and gummies that function as both a sleep aid and an aphrodisiac, said Eric Blazak, the company’s founder and chief executive.

What should older people know about cannabis?
Because cannabis is not federally legal, doctors don’t have enough research to guide them on what conditions it is helpful for, who might be at higher risk for potential harms, how to dose it properly or which strains to recommend, said Dr. Benjamin Han, an addiction medicine specialist at the University of California, San Diego, and one of the few geriatricians in the United States who studies older adults and substance use.

“What makes it even more complicated is cannabis is a very complex plant,” he added, and there are more than 100 cannabinoids — the biologically active components in the cannabis plant — as well as products with different ratios of THC to cannabidiol, or CBD.

Start low and slow. If a patient wants to try cannabis products containing THC, Dr. Han recommends starting at a low dose (generally 1 milligram to 2.5 milligrams) and then “give it one week” before making the decision to increase it.

Taking too many edibles can cause dizziness, confusion, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, panic attacks, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and can even land some people in the emergency room.

There’s also the potential for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, a condition that causes recurrent vomiting in heavy marijuana users.

One study, led by Dr. Han, found that emergency department visits associated with cannabis use among older adults rose more than 1,800 percent in California — from 366 in 2005 to 12,167 in 2019.

Older users may lean on their prior experience with the drug, but “the cannabis today is very different,” he said. “It is stronger. And then on top of that, there are all these physiological changes with aging that make you more sensitive than you would have been 40 years ago.”

Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor. “It’s important to talk with a clinician or health provider, especially if you’re using it for medical reasons to treat chronic disease or chronic symptoms,” Dr. Han said.

Cannabis can interact with certain medications, like warfarin, a drug used to treat blood clots. And seniors who take sedative-hypnotics like Ambien or benzodiazepines like Xanax — or who drink alcohol — should consider avoiding cannabis, Dr. Solomon said, because when paired with those drugs, it can cause dizziness and confusion and make seniors more susceptible to falls and injuries.

And smoking cannabis can trigger respiratory symptoms in those with chronic lung disease, Dr. Han added.

Educate yourself. Ms. Verner recommended going to licensed dispensaries that sell products that have been tested by a third party. Familiarize yourself with state regulations, too, she said.

“You just need to educate yourself, not be afraid of things — learn for yourself,” Ms. Verner said. “You need to know what may work for you — and you go from there.”

Through trial and error, she discovered that cannabinol, or CBN, which is not psychoactive, was most helpful for her insomnia.

Now she takes fewer pills: just one for her thyroid levels and another to reduce her blood pressure.

Many older adults “end up with all these bottles of medicine,” she said. “And I don’t think that’s necessary.”

"U.S. Presses China to Stop Flow of Fentanyl
President Biden put pressure on Xi Jinping to crack down on the Chinese facilities that make chemical compounds used in potent drugs.

President Biden pressed the Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday to crack down on the Chinese firms that are helping to produce fentanyl, a potent drug that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.

A plan to curb China’s illicit exports of fentanyl and, particularly, the chemicals that can be combined to make the drug was hoped to be one of the more significant achievements for the United States out of Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi’s meeting, which took place as leaders from Pacific nations gathered for an international conference in San Francisco.

After the meeting, Mr. Biden outlined an agreement to work with China to counter the narcotics trade.

China is home to a thriving chemical industry that pumps out compounds that are made into pharmaceuticals, fragrances, textile dyes and fertilizers. Some of those same compounds can also be combined to create fentanyl, an opioid that can be 100 times as potent as morphine.

U.S. officials argue that this vast chemical industry is playing a key role in the American fentanyl crisis by supplying the bulk of materials used in illegal drug labs, including in Mexico, which is now the largest exporter of fentanyl to the United States.

The Chinese government denies that its country plays such a pivotal role and instead blames the United States for harboring a culture of drug use.

“All-out marketing by pharmaceutical companies, over-prescription by doctors, ineffective government crackdowns and the negative implications of marijuana legalization are among the combination of factors behind an ever-growing market for narcotics,” China’s foreign ministry said in a statement last year.

Relations Between China and the U.S.
Electric Cars: The Biden administration has proposed new rules aimed at shifting more production of electric vehicle batteries and the materials that power them to the United States, in an attempt to build up a strategic industry dominated by China.
Student Exchanges: The flow of students between China and the United States has been a mainstay of their relationship, even when ties have soured. Now these exchanges, too, are under threat.
Artificial Intelligence: The White House has been trying to blunt China’s ambitions to gain supremacy in the world’s cutting-edge technologies. An Emirati A.I. is at the center of that effort.
Biden-Xi Meeting: China’s leader, Xi Jinping, met with President Biden for the first time in a year. The meeting, which took place in San Francisco ahead of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, highlighted a subtle shift in the power dynamic between their two countries.
U.S. officials say they have stopped more fentanyl from coming into the United States in the past two years than in the previous five years combined. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fentanyl and other synthetic opioids may have resulted in more than 77,000 overdose deaths in the United States between May 2022 and April 2023. The problem with fentanyl overdoses is particularly acute in San Francisco, where Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi are meeting.

Ian Johnson, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that getting China to agree to do something about fentanyl would resonate more with average Americans than the typical “deliverables” from international meetings.

“For Biden, that would be nice to have to show to the heartland of the United States that relations with China are more than just some esoteric matter, but can actually bring something to ordinary people,” Mr. Johnson said in a briefing held by the council last week. Republicans have made fentanyl-related deaths a central piece of their campaign against Mr. Biden and Democrats in the 2024 elections.

Still, given the difficulties with policing an illicit industry, the extent to which an agreement would curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States is unclear.

Roselyn Hsueh, an associate professor of political science at Temple University, said that an agreement between Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi could lead the Chinese central government to provide more oversight and invest more resources into inspection and monitoring. But she said Beijing had run into difficulty in the past clamping down on fentanyl and precursor chemicals.

Before 2019, China was the primary source of fentanyl coming into the United States, typically through the mail and other commercial couriers. As a part of trade talks with President Donald J. Trump, the Chinese government in 2019 agreed to prohibit the production, sale and export of all fentanyl-related drugs except through special licenses.

That led to a sharp reduction in direct fentanyl shipments from China. But it resulted in Chinese companies rerouting to Mexico and India’s emergence as a new production site, Ms. Hsueh said. The main source of U.S. fentanyl became Mexican criminal organizations, which used Chinese-made components and Chinese money-laundering services.

Today, online sales that mask the identities of sellers and buyers further complicate enforcement. The regulation and enforcement of fentanyl and precursor chemicals remain “fragmented and decentralized” among Chinese local governments, industry associations and firms with vested interests in the chemical trade, Ms. Hsueh said.

U.S. officials have said that problem is compounded because many of the ingredients used to make fentanyl are legal chemicals that can be used for legitimate purposes in other industries. The United States has issued sanctions against dozens of people in China and Hong Kong for their role in fentanyl trafficking. In September, Mr. Biden added China to the U.S. list of the world’s major drug-producing countries, a move that the Chinese government denounced as “a malicious smear.”

Last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection released an updated strategy to combat fentanyl and synthetic drugs, including through the enhanced use of data and counterintelligence operations to track drug manufacturing and distribution networks, and target suspicious locations and recipients that demonstrate patterns of illicit activity.

“In my 30 years as a customs official, the trafficking of synthetic illicit drugs like fentanyl is one of the toughest, most daunting challenges I have ever seen,” said Troy Miller, the acting commissioner for the customs agency.

U.S. officials believe China’s dominance as a chemical producer makes Beijing’s cooperation key for enforcement. Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo, have raised the issue with top Chinese officials during recent trips to China.

When six lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, had a chance to talk to Mr. Xi during a visit to China last month, the main issue they brought up was not trade or military coordination or climate change, but the harm that fentanyl had caused in their home states.

“Everyone told stories, personal stories about how, you know, friends of ours, family, have died from fentanyl, and how this was a really important issue, and I think that you could tell that made an impression on him, how deeply we felt about it,” said Mr. Schumer, a New York Democrat.

Fentanyl precursors from China have become a bipartisan issue in Congress, and the six senators who spoke with Mr. Xi were three Democrats and three Republicans.

“China needs to enforce laws that prevent the export of fentanyl precursors to international drug markets,” said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana.

Despite the scale of the problem, there is hope that greater coordination between the United States and China could improve the situation. Cooperation between the countries on preventing shipments of the precursor chemicals stalled several years ago after the United States placed sanctions on a Chinese government entity for its alleged involvement in human rights abuses in China’s westernmost region, Xinjiang.

That entity was located at the same address in Beijing as the National Narcotics Laboratory of China, which plays a key role in China’s law enforcement effort on drug-related chemicals.

Chinese officials deeply resent American sanctions on their institutions, and U.S. officials have taken the position that because of the risk of confusion among the two institutes at the same address, neither institute can work with the United States.

China then broadened its position in August 2022 when it halted any counternarcotics coordination with the United States as one of a series of measures taken in response to a visit to Taiwan by Representative Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the House. Beijing claims Taiwan, a self-ruled island democracy, as part of its territory."
"V.A. Recruits Millionth Veteran for Its Genetic Research Database

The News
On Saturday, after a 12-year effort, the Department of Veterans Affairs reached a long-term goal — it enrolled the millionth veteran in a genetic database, the Million Veteran Program.

According to the V.A., the Million Veteran Program is the largest such database in the world. It includes not only genetic information but also is linked to the department’s electronic medical records and even contains records of diet and environmental exposure.

The department says its data are available for now only to V.A. doctors and scientists, most of whom also have academic appointments. They have published hundreds of studies using what has already been collected.

A Moment That Sums It Up: 3:46 p.m.
The millionth vet joined the database on the afternoon of Nov. 8. Employees who had waited a dozen years for this moment wept.

As the goal approached, the department had started an intensive email campaign, encouraging vets to sign up online or at V.A. medical centers. In the few weeks building up to the millionth vet, what had been a few hundred enrollees a day turned into thousands. The department created a ticker, which it posted online, showing the numbers.

“This is a gift to the world,” said Dr. Shereef Elnahal, the under secretary for health in the Department sVeterans Affairs.

The V.A. will continue to enroll more vets to the database, but this was a symbolic moment.

Why It Matters: A diverse database yields disease insights.
For years, researchers have been building large databases for genetic research. Using them they have found, for example, genes that appear to confer resistance to dementia and ones that most likely contribute to obesity. The discoveries provide paths to understanding these diseases and developing treatments.

There are other large genetic databases, but they have mostly been built in Europe and include few minorities. The V.A. says its database offers a more diverse population: 175,000 people with African ancestry and 80,000 Hispanics joined the Million Veteran Program. The database also includes 100,000 women.

“It’s a massive investment and scientific opportunity,” said Dr. Amit V. Khera, a genetic researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. He is not a V.A. researcher, but he has used the data through collaborations with researchers who are affiliated with the department.

As the database acquired participants, about 600 V.A. researchers registered to use it. The result so far has been more than 350 papers on diseases and disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, heart disease, high blood pressure and nonalcoholic liver disease.

For example, said Dr. Sumitra Muralidhar, director of the Million Veteran Program, researchers found genes linked to having flashbacks of traumatic events, a feature of post-traumatic stress. Now, Dr. Muralidhar said, investigators can study those genes and the role they play, which may help in developing treatments for PTSD.

The department also says it is being mindful of patient privacy. Although researchers can examine genetic and other data and links to medical records, fewer than 10 people at the V.A. have the links that tie records to individuals. Those records, Dr. Muralidhar said, are held at a facility in Boston that is “heavily secured.”

What It Looks Like: Veterans hope the database will help.
In 2019, a nurse at a V.A. hospital told Octavia Harris, 60, of San Antonio, about the Million Veteran Program. She signed up and said participating was a chance to help other vets and to help herself.

Ms. Harris, who retired from the Navy in 2012 after 30 years of service, said three conditions run in her family — diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis. She is hoping that with her genetic and health information added to that of so many others, researchers will make useful discoveries.

In her family, Ms. Harris said, people died young.

“We haven’t lived beyond the age of 70,” she said. “I want to go past 70.”"
"Health Risks Linked to Climate Change Are Getting Worse, Experts Warn
The 8th update to a major international report shows more people are getting sick and dying from extreme heat, drought and other climate problems.

Climate change continues to have a worsening effect on health and mortality around the world, according to an exhaustive report published on Tuesday by an international team of 114 researchers.

One of the starkest findings is that heat-related deaths of people older than 65 have increased by 85 percent since the 1990s, according to modeling that incorporates both changing temperatures and demographics. People in this age group, along with babies, are especially vulnerable to health risks like heat stroke. As global temperatures have risen, older people and infants now are exposed to twice the number of heat-wave days annually as they were from 1986 to 2005.

The report, published in the medical journal The Lancet, also tracked estimated lost income and food insecurity. Globally, exposure to extreme heat, and resulting losses in productivity or inability to work, may have led to income losses as high as $863 billion in 2022. And, in 2021, an estimated 127 million more people experienced moderate or severe food insecurity linked to heat waves and droughts, compared with 1981-2010.

“We’ve lost very precious years of climate action and that has come at an enormous health cost,” said Marina Romanello, a researcher at University College London and the executive director of the report, known as The Lancet Countdown. “The loss of life, the impact that people experience, is irreversible.”

The indicators of public health tracked in the report have generally declined over the nine years the researchers have produced editions of the assessment.

The analysis also examined health outcomes for individual countries, including the United States. Heat-related deaths of adults 65 and older increased by 88 percent between 2018 and 2022, compared with 2000-04. An estimated 23,200 older Americans died in 2022 because of exposure to extreme heat.

For health practitioners, the statistics are not abstract or faceless.

“These numbers remind me of the elderly patients I see in my own hospital with heatstroke,” said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Dr. Salas is one of the report’s co-authors and said she viewed the project like tracking vital signs in a patient, but on a national and international scale.

The data can help fill a gap for federal policymakers.

“We have a limited set of indicators for climate change and health that are routinely collected in the United States,” said Dr. John Balbus, director of the office of climate change and health equity in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. He did not contribute to this report and is not currently involved with The Lancet Countdown, but previously served as a scientific adviser to the project’s funder.

Dr. Balbus cautioned that this report mostly measures people’s exposure to climate-related risks rather than actual health outcomes, such as rates of disease. In order to get from exposures to real health outcomes, he said more investment in research was needed.

For the first time, this year’s Lancet Countdown included projections for the future. If the global average temperature rises by 2 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial temperatures, an increasingly likely future unless society significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, the number of heat-related deaths each year will increase by 370 percent by the middle of this century, the report found.

At the same time, the researchers point out that reducing fossil fuel pollution is proving beneficial for global health. Deaths from air pollution related to fossil fuels have decreased by 15 percent since 2005, with most of that improvement a result of less coal-related pollution entering the atmosphere.

The value of The Lancet Countdown is its ongoing monitoring of climate change’s effects on global health, said Sharon Friel, director of the Planetary Health Equity Hothouse at the Australian National University.

Dr. Friel was not involved in the report, but read it and wrote an accompanying commentary.

Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former special assistant to the director for climate change and health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the report was a valuable dashboard but that the climate impacts he most worried about were not the obvious ones highlighted. Researchers and policymakers need to pay attention to the health effects of people being displaced by climate change and migrating, Dr. Frumkin said.

“If you’re on cancer chemotherapy or if you are getting kidney dialysis or if you’re getting addiction treatment and you have to move suddenly, that’s terribly disruptive and threatening,” he said. Dr. Frumkin was not involved in the new report but was a co-author on previous editions.

Over the years, the health experts involved in this project have included more research about the continued use of fossil fuels being the root cause of health issues.

“The diagnosis in this report is very clear,” Dr. Salas said. “Further expansion of fossil fuels is reckless and the data clearly shows that it threatens the health and well-being of every person.”

The researchers point out that health care systems, and other societal infrastructure health care depends on, haven’t adapted quickly enough to our current level of global warming.

“If we haven’t been able to cope today, chances are we won’t be able to cope in the future,” Dr. Romanello said.

The report is likely to be discussed at the annual United Nations climate summit in the United Arab Emirates that starts in a few weeks. This year the summit will include a greater focus on human health."
"Inside the Desperate Effort to Evacuate Young Cancer Patients From Gaza
A mission to rescue cancer-stricken children from the violence in Gaza has involved multiple countries and last-minute connections in the chaos of war.

They are some of the most vulnerable in Gaza.

The youngest is not even a year old; the oldest is 14. All are battling lymphoma, leukemia and tumors that doctors said could kill them if left untreated.

Over the past 10 days, 21 children with cancer have been evacuated from Gaza to hospitals in Egypt and Jordan, according to doctors involved in the effort. But at least 30 other young cancer patients have not made it out, and aid workers said that in the chaos of war, they can no longer reach some of the families.

“This is catastrophic,” said Dr. Bakr Gaoud, the head of Al-Rantisi Specialized Hospital for Children, which was the only medical center with a pediatric cancer ward in Gaza until it was forced to shut down on Friday during heavy fighting. Even before the hospital closed, critically ill patients were being sent home through violent streets or transferred to Al-Shifa, a nearby hospital that is under siege by Israeli forces.

Hospitals have become a particular flash point in the war as Israel has accused Hamas of turning medical facilities, including Al-Rantisi and Al-Shifa, into safe houses and command centers. Hamas and hospital officials have denied the allegations.

The effort to evacuate children with cancer began in mid-October and required negotiations among the White House, Egypt, Israel and Palestinian health officials in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas.

But those involved in the evacuation said it has proceeded fitfully.

Aid workers and doctors, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the efforts, described frantic families who lost their cell service and missed the specific days when their children had been given permission to cross into Egypt. Some waited for hours for ambulances that never made it to a meeting point.

One family arrived at the border only to discover that their child had been approved to cross, but the parent’s name had been inexplicably left off the list.

The children’s plight is a microcosm of the suffering in Gaza since the war began just over a month ago, after Hamas launched a surprise assault that Israeli authorities say killed 1,200 people. Israel’s retaliation has killed more than 11,000 people, including more than 4,500 children, according to health officials in Gaza.

Most of the children with cancer were being treated at Al-Rantisi, which had 35 inpatient pediatric cancer patients as of two weeks ago, Dr. Gaoud said. But as shells hit the hospital’s water tanks and power system over the past week, it began to empty out.

On Friday, Dr. Gaoud said, Al-Rantisi was forced to shut down entirely, with staff members dragging some patients outside in their beds to wait for ambulances. Israeli soldiers provided a map of what they said was a safe route through the fighting.

The children were given one last dose of chemotherapy before they left. Without further care, Dr. Gaoud said, “their cases will deteriorate.”

The emergency effort to evacuate the patients was organized by the World Health Organization and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which had been involved in building up services at Al-Rantisi.

The organizations created a registry of children to be moved, with phone numbers for their relatives. St. Jude also promised to organize their transport into Egypt and ensure their medical care.

But the names of the children had to be added to a daily list of those approved to pass through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt, which was no simple task. More than two weeks passed with no evacuations.

St. Jude appealed to the White House, which had partnered with the organization on a similar evacuation of pediatric cancer patients in Ukraine. Desperate messages from hospitals were already fueling the Biden administration’s push for humanitarian pauses in the conflict, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House communications.

The official was shown text messages from medical workers in Gaza. One that reached the White House came from an Al-Rantisi nurse.

“Never in my life did I think we as a cancer hospital will be under siege with missiles, and phosphorus bombs are everywhere,” the nurse wrote. “I swear I said we need to get our message and voice out. Speak to the White House, to anyone.”

“This is enough, stop, this is enough. We are a hospital for kids,” the message said. “Many are taking shelter, and none of them have any weapons or anything. They lift their hands and ask for help. These are sick cancer kids. This is a catastrophe.”

U.S. officials have managed to secure passage of some 400 Americans through the Rafah crossing into Egypt since the war began, and they used those same channels to help get the pediatric cancer patients on the list for safe passage, according to a senior administration official.

The list of people allowed through the crossing is compiled daily and is coordinated by Egypt, which has taken in the bulk of the evacuees. Israel, which vets the list to ensure that it does not include Hamas fighters, raised no objection to the Americans’ request to make the patients a priority, a senior administration official said.

Curtis Ried, the chief of staff for the National Security Council, said President Biden “directed us to do whatever we could to help these kids get out.”

“So we’re still hopeful and we’re still pushing every day to see if we can help get these other children out,” Mr. Ried said.

On Monday, as Gaza’s health system collapsed by the hour, Mr. Biden said that the hospitals must be protected. On Tuesday, in a message posted on X, formerly Twitter, he said that the evacuation of the children with cancer “wouldn’t have been possible without coordination between the U.S., regional partners” and St. Jude.

“We’ll continue facilitating care for more children outside of Gaza,” he said.

The first patient crossed on Nov. 4, followed by eight more two days later, then several more groups for a total of 21 as of Tuesday. The remaining children, whose ages ranged from a few months to 14, have been approved to leave, but it is unclear when or whether they will be able to given the violence in the streets.

Most of the children who have not made it out yet are trapped in northern Gaza, where the fighting is raging, a doctor involved in the evacuation said. An aid worker said one family walked 11 hours to make it to the Rafah crossing.

A 7-year-old girl was among the most dire cases. When the war started, she had just been diagnosed with leukemia, or blood cancer, according to doctors involved in the evacuation effort. She had been scheduled to be taken outside Gaza for care. But she could not be moved because of the violence, and her white blood cell count rose dangerously high.

As the fighting intensified, her family fled with her to southern Gaza, looking for safety and shelter. When the girl was approved for evacuation, aid workers were unable to reach her parent for two days because of problems with telephone service.

When they finally got in contact, an ambulance was hastily organized to get the girl to the border. But that day, for some reason, no one was allowed to cross. Only in the past few days did the girl make it to Egypt.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the W.H.O.’s representative for Gaza and the West Bank, said the evacuation of the children so far is “a small glimmer of hope” in an overwhelming humanitarian crisis. But, he added, “Many more children and adults urgently need medical evacuation outside Gaza. Time is running out for them.”

He also said that the breakdown in medical care will mean some children with cancer will not even be diagnosed.

At Al-Rantisi, the families of the pediatric cancer patients were a close-knit group, doctors and aid workers say. Some had known one another since their babies were born, and they had comforted one another through diagnoses and treatments. In recent weeks, they took refuge together in their children’s hospital rooms to stay safe from bombardments. They even managed to be happy for their friends who had been called from the evacuation list, even as they agonized over whether their own children ever would be.

But now, many are feared “scattered into the streets,” said Steve Sosebee, the founder and president of the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which opened the oncology ward at Al-Rantisi in 2019, building up a supply of cancer drugs and a training staff.

When the bombardments began, many families decided that they would go the rest of their cancer journey alone. “Some families took it upon themselves to leave, even though they had no place to go and their child had no alternative medical care available to them outside of the department,” Mr. Sosebee said.

Al-Rantisi’s young cancer patients had endured conflicts before that had disrupted their treatment. But never such a confluence of risks — including bombings, dehydration and malnutrition, said Dr. Zeena Salman, a pediatric oncologist based in the United States who has worked with patients in Gaza for eight years.

“In this case, the stakes are much, much higher for these children,” Dr. Salman said. “The ones who are spared deaths from bombs, certainly these delays in their treatment, put them at higher risk. So, there’s kind of a risk of acute death, or if they survive, the risk of not being able to be cured of their cancer.”"
"Race Cannot Be Used to Predict Heart Disease, Scientists Say
The American Heart Association will release a new clinical tool that removes race as a factor in predicting who will have heart attacks or strokes.

Doctors have long relied on a few key patient characteristics to assess risk of a heart attack or stroke, using a calculus that considers blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking and diabetes status, as well as demographics: age, sex and race.

Now, the American Heart Association is taking race out of the equation.

The overhaul of the widely used cardiac-risk algorithm is an acknowledgment that, unlike sex or age, race identification in and of itself is not a biological risk factor.

The scientists who modified the algorithm decided from the start that race itself did not belong in clinical tools used to guide medical decision making, even though race might serve as a proxy for certain social circumstances, genetic predispositions or environmental exposures that raise the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The revision comes amid rising concern about health equity and racial bias within the U.S. health care system, and is part of a broader trend toward removing race from a variety of clinical algorithms.

“We should not be using race to inform whether someone gets a treatment or doesn’t get a treatment,” said Dr. Sadiya Khan, a preventive cardiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who chaired the statement writing committee for the American Heart Association, or A.H.A.

The statement was published on Friday in the association’s journal, Circulation. An online calculator using the new algorithm, called PREVENT, is still in development.

“Race is a social construct,” Dr. Khan said, adding that including race in clinical equations “can cause significant harm by implying that it is a biological predictor.”

That doesn’t mean that Black Americans are not at higher risk of dying of cardiovascular disease than white Americans, she said. They are, and life expectancy of Black Americans is shorter as well, she added.

But race has been used in algorithms as a stand-in for a range of factors that are working against Black Americans, Dr. Khan said. It’s not clear to scientists what all of those risks are. If they were better understood, “we could address them and work to modify them,” she said.

The heart-risk assessment has also been improved in several other significant ways. It can be used by people as young as 30, unlike the earlier algorithm, which was only valid for those 40 and over, and estimates the 10-year and 30-year total cardiovascular risk.

The assessment has been redesigned, for the first time, to estimate an individual’s risk of developing heart failure, not just heart attack and stroke. That is important because heart failure has been on the rise in recent years with the aging of the population and the high prevalence of obesity. The condition can lead to a severe deterioration in quality of life.

Also for the first time, the new calculator takes kidney function into account when predicting risk, as kidney disease puts people at higher risk of heart disease, heart attacks, heart failure and stroke.

In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the strong connection between cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and metabolic disease (which includes Type 2 diabetes and obesity). Last month, scientific advisers to the association defined a new disorder called cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, or C.K.M.

“C.K.M. is associated with significantly premature mortality, mostly from cardiovascular disease,” said Dr. Chiadi Ndumele, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine who was also an author of the new scientific statement.

“It is disproportionately present when there are any adverse social determinants of health,” he said, which include “the social context in which we eat, work, learn and play.”

The new equation also has options for including a measure of blood sugar control, called hemoglobin A1C, in people with Type 2 diabetes, and for incorporating a factor called the Social Deprivation Index, which includes poverty, unemployment, education and other factors.

The changes are “great news,” said Dr. David S. Jones, a psychiatrist and professor of the history of medicine at Harvard, who wrote a paper about the use of race in myriad medical decision-making algorithms that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2020.

The paper described how race has been used in a broad array of clinical algorithms relied upon to make medical judgments about conditions as diverse as urinary tract infections, vaginal birth after cesarean sections, breast cancer, lung function and kidney function.

“It’s been hugely gratifying to see how medical thinking has shifted about this issue over the past three to five years,” Dr. Jones said.

While there are racial gaps on many health measures, scientists must conduct research to understand exactly what is causing the differences, he said, adding, “You can’t just divide the world into Black and white people, and say that all the white people get this and all the Black people get that.”

Putting the changes into effect can be difficult, however, he said.

Two years ago, a scientific task force of the National Kidney Foundation and American Society of Nephrology called for jettisoning a measure of kidney function that adjusted results by race, often making Black patients seem less ill than they are and leading to delays in treatment.

Within 18 months, about 65 percent of all lab facilities had adopted the new approach, said Dr. Neil Powe, chief of medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and a professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco.

Dr. Powe said he shared a concern that was raised by the authors of the A.H.A. scientific statement: What exactly lies at the root of racial health disparities?

“I have said many times that we need to do more research to understand what race is capturing and what the substitute for it is,” Dr. Powe said.

Many physicians do not know whether or to what degree their patients are experiencing social stressors that affect their health. Research on maternal deaths, for example, has shown that wealth and higher education do not compensate for the ill health effects associated with being Black in America.

Although the wealthiest mothers and their babies are most likely to survive the year after childbirth, a California study found that the same was not true for Black women — the wealthiest Black mothers and their babies are twice as likely to die, compared with the richest white mothers and their babies."
"Methodology for Analysis of the U.S. Health and Retirement Study
An explanation of the findings from the federally financed survey to assess long-term care needs and finances of those 65 and older.

The Times/KFF Health News data analysis was based on the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of about 20,000 people over age 50. The analysis defined people ages 65 and above as likely to need long-term care if they were assessed to have dementia, or if they reported having difficulty with two or more out of six activities of daily living. The six activities are bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed, walking across a room and using the toilet. The Langa-Weir classification of cognitive function, a related data set, was used to identify respondents with dementia. The analysis’ definition of needing long-term care assistance is conservative and is in line with criteria most long-term care insurers use in determining whether they will pay for services.

People were described as recipients of long-term care help if they reported receiving assistance in the month before the survey interview or if they lived in a nursing home. The analysis was developed in consultation with Norma Coe, an associate professor of medical ethics and health policy at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

The financial toll on middle-class and upper-income people needing long-term care was examined by reviewing data that the H.R.S. collected between 2000 and 2021 on wealthy Americans, those whose net worth at age 65 was in the 50th to 95th percentile, totaling anywhere from $171,365 to $1,827,765 in inflation-adjusted 2020 dollars. This group excludes the super-wealthy. Each individual’s wealth at age 65 was compared with their wealth just before they died to calculate the percentage of affluent people who exhausted their financial resources and the likelihood that would occur among different groups.

To calculate how many people were likely to need long-term care, how many people needing long-term care services were receiving them, and who was providing care to people receiving help, we looked at people ages 65 and older of all wealth levels in the 2020-21 survey, the most recent.

The U.S. Health and Retirement Study is conducted by the University of Michigan, and funded by the National Institute on Aging and the Social Security Administration.

The analysis was conducted by Albert Sun, a graphics editor for The Times, and Holly K. Hacker, a data editor for KFF Health News, part of the organization formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation."
"What Long-Term Care Looks Like Around the World
Most countries spend more than the United States on care, but middle class and affluent people still bear a substantial portion of the costs.

Around the world, wealthy countries are struggling to afford long-term care for rapidly aging populations. Most spend more than the United States through government funding or insurance that individuals are legally required to obtain. Some protect individuals from exhausting all their income or wealth paying for long-term care. But as in the United States, middle-class and affluent individuals in many countries can bear a substantial portion of the costs.

The U.S. spends less as a share of G.D.P. on long-term care than most other wealthy countries.

Here’s how five other countries pay for long-term care.

JAPAN. Long-term care insurance is mandatory for Japanese citizens age 40 and over, while in the United States only a small portion of people voluntarily obtain coverage. Half the funding for Japan’s program comes from tax revenues and half from premiums. Older adults contribute 10 to 30 percent of the cost of services, depending on their income, and insurance picks up the rest. There is a maximum amount people have to spend from their income before the insurance covers the remainder of the cost. Workers can also take up to 93 days of paid leave to help relatives with long-term care needs. Japan assigns a care manager to each person using services; each manager oversees about 40 older adults. In 2020, Japan spent 2 percent of its gross domestic product on long-term care, 67 percent more than the United States spent that year.

THE NETHERLANDS. The Dutch have included long-term care in their universal health care system since 1968. One public insurance program pays for nursing homes and other institutional settings, and another pays for nursing and personal care at home. Enrollment is mandatory. Dutch taxpayers contribute nearly 10 percent of their income toward insurance premiums, up to a set amount. Out-of-pocket payments amount to about 7 percent of the cost of institutional care. General taxes pay for a third program in which municipalities provide financial assistance and social support for older people living at home. There is no private long-term care insurance. The Netherlands spent 4.1 percent of its gross domestic product on long-term care in 2021, more than any other country tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and four times the amount the United States spent.

CANADA. Provinces and territories fund long-term care services through general tax revenue. Money budgeted is not always enough to cover all services, and some localities give priority to those with the greatest needs. The amount of subsidies people can receive, the costs they have to pay out of pocket and the availability of services vary by province and territory, as they do in the United States with state Medicaid programs. The mix of providers also varies regionally: For instance, nursing home care in Quebec is mostly run by a public system while homes in Ontario are mostly for-profit. Notably, Canada’s long-term care system is separate from its national health care system, which pays for hospitals and doctors with no out-of-pocket costs to patients. In 2021, Canada spent 1.8 percent of its G.D.P. on long-term care, 80 percent more than the United States spent.

BRITAIN. Local authorities pay for most long-term care through taxes and central government grants. Private providers usually supply services. Government contributions are based on financial need, with co-payments usually required. As in the United States, middle-class and wealthy people pay most or all of the costs themselves. Unlike in the United States, the government provides payments directly to lower-income people so they can hire workers to care for them in their homes. Britain has also taken steps to shield people from losing all of their wealth to pay for long-term care. It subsidizes care for people with savings and property of less than about $30,000, while in the United States most people don’t qualify for Medicaid until they have run through all but $2,000 to $3,000 of their assets. In 2022, the government proposed extending subsidies to people who have as much as $105,000 of wealth and property, with a lifetime cap of about $100,000 on how much anyone spends on long-term medical care, excluding room and board in a nursing home. But the plan has been postponed to 2025. In 2021, Britain spent 1.8 percent of its G.D.P. on long-term care, 80 percent more than the United States did.

SINGAPORE. Singapore recently instituted a system of mandatory long-term care insurance for those born in 1980 or later. Citizens and permanent residents are automatically enrolled in an insurance plan called CareShield Life starting at age 30. They must pay premiums until they retire or turn 67 (whichever comes later) or are approved to use services. The government subsidizes 20 to 30 percent of premiums for those who earn around $2,000 a month or less. Monthly payouts start at about $440. Government subsidies for nursing homes and other institutional care can range from 10 percent to 75 percent depending on ability to pay. Those who make more than $2,000 a month receive no subsidies. CareShield is optional for Singaporeans born in 1979 or earlier; they are covered under an older, voluntary plan. Singapore also provides a means-tested monthly cash grant — this year about $290 — to help with caregiving expenses."
"An ‘Unsettling’ Drop in Life Expectancy for Men

The News
The gap in life expectancy between men and women in the United States grew to its widest in nearly 30 years, driven mainly by more men dying of Covid and drug overdoses, according to a new study in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.

In 2021, women had a life expectancy of 79.3 years, compared with 73.5 years for men, the study found.

“It was unsettling to see,” said Dr. Brandon Yan, a resident physician at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of the study, which analyzed death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“We need to understand which groups are particularly losing out on years of life expectancy so interventions can be at least partially focused on these groups,” Dr. Yan said.

Background: The life expectancy gap has substantially widened — and shrunk — before.
At the turn of the 20th century, women had a life expectancy just two years higher than men, Dr. Yan said. But over the next 75 years, that gap began to widen, largely because more men smoked and developed cardiovascular disease or lung cancer.

As smoking rates declined, excess deaths reduced among men, in particular.

But in 2010, that gender gap began to widen yet again, this time driven by opioid overdose death rates, which are more than twice as high for men. That year, the life expectancy for men was 76.3 years, while for women it was 78.1.

Men had a greater risk of developing diabetes and heart disease, and also faced higher rates of homicide and suicide.

The Findings: Covid caused huge drops in life expectancy across the board.
More than 1.1 million people in the United States have died of Covid, a staggering death toll that has caused precipitous declines in life expectancy. Between 2019 and 2021, the life expectancy in the United States dropped from around 79 to 76 years.

But men have died of Covid at a higher rate than women. The reasons for this are complicated. Biological factors, like differences in inflammation and immune responses, likely played a significant role.

But social and behavioral differences mattered, too. Men are more likely to work in industries with higher rates of Covid exposure and fatalities, including transportation, agriculture and construction, or to experience incarceration or homelessness. Women are also more likely to be vaccinated.

From 2019 to 2021, Covid was the leading contributor to the widening gap in life expectancy between men and women, contributing nearly 40 percent of the difference in years lost.

Overdose and homicide deaths increased, too.
Unintentional injuries — mostly drug overdoses — contributed to more than 30 percent of the life expectancy gap between men and women. But more men also died by homicide or suicide between 2019 and 2021.

“All of these point to a picture of worsening mental health across the board, but particularly among men,” Dr. Yan said.

Dr. Yan noted that his analysis did not include transgender or other gender identities, because death certificates do not record that information."
"A Monster’: Super Meth and Other Drugs Push Crisis Beyond Opioids
Millions of U.S. drug users now are addicted to several substances, not just opioids like fentanyl and heroin. The shift is making treatment far more difficult.

Dr. Nic Helmstetter crab-walked down a steep, rain-slicked trail into a grove of maple and cottonwood trees to his destination: a dozen tents in a clearing by the Kalamazoo River, surrounded by the detritus of lives perpetually on the move. Discarded red plastic cups. A wet sock flung over a bush. A carpet square. And scattered across the forest floor: orange vial caps and used syringes.

Kalamazoo, a small city in Western Michigan, is a way station along the drug trafficking corridor between Chicago and Detroit. In its parks, under railroad overpasses and here in the woods, people ensnared by drugs scramble to survive. Dr. Helmstetter, who makes weekly primary care rounds with a program called Street Medicine Kalamazoo, carried medications to reverse overdoses, blunt cravings and ease withdrawal-induced nausea.

But increasingly, the utility of these therapies, developed to address the decades-old opioid crisis, is diminishing. They work to counteract the most devastating effects of fentanyl and heroin, but most users now routinely test positive for other substances too, predominantly stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine, for which there are no approved medications.

Rachel, 35, her hair dyed a silvery lavender, ran to greet Dr. Helmstetter. She takes the medicine buprenorphine, which acts to dull her body’s yearning for opioids, but she was not ready to let go of meth.

“I prefer both, actually,” she said. “I like to be up and down at the same time.”

The United States is in a new and perilous period in its battle against illicit drugs. The scourge is not only opioids, such as fentanyl, but a rapidly growing practice that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labels “polysubstance use.”

Over the last three years, studies of people addicted to opioids (a population estimated to be in the millions) have consistently shown that between 70 and 80 percent also take other illicit substances, a shift that is stymieing treatment efforts and confounding state, local and federal policies.

“It’s no longer an opioid epidemic,” said Dr. Cara Poland, an associate professor at the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. “This is an addiction crisis.”

The non-opioid drugs include those relatively new to the street, like the animal tranquilizer xylazine, which can char human flesh, anti-anxiety medications like Valium and Klonopin and older recreational stimulants like cocaine and meth. Dealers sell these drugs, plus counterfeit Percocet and Xanax pills, often mixed with fentanyl.

The incursion of meth has been particularly problematic. Not only is there no approved medical treatment for meth addiction, but meth can also undercut the effectiveness of opioid addiction therapies. Meth explodes the pleasure receptors, but also induces paranoia and hallucinations, works like a slow acid on teeth and heart valves and can inflict long-lasting brain changes.

The Biden administration has been pouring billions into opioid interventions and policing traffickers, but has otherwise lagged in keeping pace with the evolution of drug use. There has been comparatively little discussion about meth and cocaine, despite the fact that during the 12-month period ending in May 2023, over 34,000 deaths were attributed to methamphetamine and 28,000 to cocaine, according to provisional federal data.

Just last month, the Food and Drug Administration issued draft guidelines for the development of therapies for stimulant-use disorders “critically needed to address treatment gaps.”

In the Street Medicine van up the road from the tents, Dr. Sravani Alluri, the program’s director and a family medicine physician, gave Rachel an injection of antipsychotic medicine and then sorted through lab results showing the chilling omnipresence of numerous substances.

Patient No. 1: positive for fentanyl, methamphetamine and xylazine.

Patient No. 2: positive for amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, THC and gabapentin, a prescription painkiller whose misuse is on the rise.

Patient No. 3: positive for fentanyl, methamphetamine, THC and xylazine.

The spread of super meth

“Treating someone for opiates is relatively easy,” said Dr. Paul Trowbridge, the addiction medicine specialist at the Trinity Health Recovery Medicine clinic in Grand Rapids, an hour north of Kalamazoo. That’s largely because of buprenorphine and methadone, federally approved medications with years of evidence attesting to their effectiveness in subduing opioid cravings, and Narcan, an over-the-counter nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.

But meth, he said, “is a monster.”

His patients typically have either Medicaid or private health insurance and a roof over their heads, even if it’s a shelter. Many have steady jobs — dental hygienists, construction workers, tech sales people.

Still, the challenges of helping them are daunting.

Their use of multiple drugs is not always voluntary. Dealers can be sloppy, Dr. Trowbridge said, or intentionally salt one drug with another, to bind customers to the new mix.

“It’s really unpredictable what people are buying, which makes it so dangerous for them,” he said. “It’s a killing field out there.”

Some opioid users seek the fireworks of meth and other stimulants to offset the warm, sleepy embrace of opioids. Some use meth to stay awake to ward off thieves and rapists.

Medications like methadone can safely replace more destructive opioids and satiate the brain’s opioid receptors. But subduing the urge for stimulants, which set off the release of stratospheric levels of the brain chemicals dopamine and serotonin, is more complex, involving many unknowns. And Narcan, which has saved at least hundreds of thousands who overdosed on opioids, has no effect on stimulants.

Moreover, depending on whether the user routinely turns to cocaine, meth or prescription amphetamine, side effects, responses and behavior patterns vary greatly.

“The truth is, we really don’t have a good answer at this point as to why it’s so challenging to develop these treatments,” said Marta Sokolowska, the deputy director for substance use and behavioral health at the F.D.A.’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Last year, according to preliminary federal data, stimulants were present in 42 percent of overdose deaths that involved opioids.

Like opioids, which originally came from the poppy, meth started out as a plant-based product, derived from the herb ephedra. Now, both drugs can be produced in bulk synthetically and cheaply. They each pack a potentially lethal, addictive wallop far stronger than their precursors.

In recent decades, opioids grew so dominant that meth and its stimulant cousins proliferated in the shadows.

A decade or so ago, Mexican drug lords figured out how to mass-produce a synthetic “super meth.” It has provoked what some researchers are calling a second meth epidemic.

Popular up and down the West Coast, super meth from Mexican and American labs has been marching East and South and into parts of the Midwest, including Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo.

Users inject, snort or ingest meth, often seeking to prolong its euphoria with binges that can last for days. Meth can also trigger violence and psychosis that emergency doctors can mistake for schizophrenia. Its long-term effects include anhedonia and memory loss.

To help patients cut back on meth, some doctors prescribe Adderall, a drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that is also a stimulant. But that avenue is narrowing, because of the drug’s nationwide shortage.

People addicted to multiple substances are far more resistant to going into treatment than single-substance users, addiction medicine experts say.

Dr. Trowbridge said some opioid patients can become stable enough to progress to monthly injectable buprenorphine. But if they are also using meth, that treatment plan often collapses.

The paranoia and hallucinations caused by meth disorient them, he said. One patient threw himself in a river to escape nonexistent people who were chasing him. Others insisted that dumpsters were talking to them, that color-coded cars were sending them messages.

So they skip appointments, returning only “when they start to hit withdrawal and realize their opioid injection is wearing off,” he said.

At the clinic that day, at least four patients were no-shows.

“We’re just trying to not have them have a heroin habit,” Dr. Trowbridge said. “But then they’re off on a meth run.”

The Opioid Crisis
Fentanyl: The drug has become a leading cause of death in the United States, an issue on the presidential campaign trail and the subject of major diplomatic efforts by the Biden administration. Here is what to know.
Narcan: The first opioid overdose reversal medication approved for over-the-counter purchase will soon arrive in many stores. Here’s what to know about buying this lifesaving drug.
Consumption Sites: A controversial strategy to blunt the opioid epidemic that has been sweeping cities like Philadelphia: supervised drug consumption sites, in which people are allowed to take illicit drugs under professional supervision.
Beyond Opioids: Millions of drug users in the United States now are addicted to several substances, not just opioids. The shift is making treatment far more difficult.
Meth, opioids and pregnancy

Sami, 30, who is addicted to meth and heroin, is pregnant with her third child, due in December.

This is her second pregnancy with the Great Moms clinic, a Grand Rapids program through Corewell Health that supports pregnant women who struggle with drug use. Citing privacy concerns in not sharing her full name, Sami, who has long, dark hair and a life-hardened jawline, had been fastidious about keeping her appointments. She is trying to get it right this time.

Three years ago, the clinic prescribed buprenorphine to help Sami contain heroin urges during her second pregnancy.

But options for meth, especially for a pregnant patient, are almost nil. Dr. Cara Poland, the clinic’s addiction medicine specialist, could rely only on gentle persuasion wrapped around an unflinching truth: that meth use during pregnancy increases the risk of having a smaller baby and of the placenta separating from the uterus, threatening the life of both mother and fetus.

Back then, Sami was living in a shelter, hungry for meth. She loved being a mom. Having to share custody of her first child with her ex was painful enough, but she knew she was in no shape to care for this second baby. Grieving, she placed the infant girl for adoption.

“It still eats at me,” she said.

Like many patients who use multiple substances, Sami has mental disabilities, including attention deficit disorder and bipolar disorder. According to federal data, more than one in four adults with serious mental disorders turns to illicit drugs. A.D.H.D. that has been poorly managed or undiagnosed is particularly common in meth patients.

“It’s almost more notable if they don’t have a disorder,” Dr. Poland said. “But sometimes the substance use itself results in mental illness — we call those ‘substance-induced depression’ or ‘substance-induced anxiety.’”

Other risk factors include a history of trauma, a genetic predisposition to addiction or a childhood among relatives dependent on alcohol or drugs. At 3, Sami, who grew up in a one-stoplight town, was in a car accident that left her mother permanently institutionalized with a brain injury. Her father drank heavily, she says; Sami’s descent into addiction began in adolescence with alcohol.

Three years ago, feeling overcome with guilt and shame after placing her daughter for adoption, she slid back into numbing her pain with heroin. And whenever her bipolar disorder medications weren’t balanced and she was feeling depressed, she reached for meth.

By last April, she had enough. “I was in a really, really nasty relationship and my mental health was bad,” she said. “I was so stuck in addiction. I needed help.” During screening for detox and rehab, she discovered she was again pregnant.

She now lives in an apartment that a Grand Rapids nonprofit helped her find, and works as a hotel receptionist. She wants to take this baby home so badly. That goal has helped her avoid meth.

“I won’t even talk to anybody that’s been using,” she said. “I’ve been really diligent, even if that means being lonely sometimes.”

Offering sterile syringes and clean pipes

Twice a week, workers from Kalamazoo Harm Reduction lug a red wagon along rutted trails to the wooded encampments. Pausing to pick up discarded syringes along the paths, they travel from tent to tent, offering free, sterile drug equipment.

They are part of the growing “harm reduction” movement that aims to save lives by preventing overdoses and serious infections.

But the prevalence of so many different drugs has complicated their efforts. The wagon typically holds:

— Packages of 10 short needles, for people still able to hit a fresh vein. Packs of 10 long ones, for those who have to dig around. (Better to use new needles than share used ones.)

— Sterile water for diluting injectable drugs. (Safer than water from the river or a public toilet.)

— Bubbles, the glass stem pipes with bowls for smoking meth. (Better to smoke from your own pipe than take hits from the pipe of someone with cracked, bleeding lips.)

The Street Medicine doctors and harm reduction workers regularly encounter people who swear their meth use is under control but could maybe use help dialing back the fentanyl. And unapologetic meth users, who insist their supply couldn’t possibly contain fentanyl.

“Finding that moment when someone says they’re ready for treatment is hard in all addiction, but meth is making this so much harder,” said Luca, a harm reduction worker who asked to be identified by only a first name because clients are often evading law enforcement. “We had a client who kept missing us on our Monday visits and he finally said, ‘I haven’t known what day it was in so long.’”

So Luca suggested: Maybe after being awake on a four-day meth binge, try a 30-minute nap? “Or we can get you a watch? So while you’re out living your life, you can look down and sort of keep track of where the rest of the world is — and when to meet up with us?”

It is so hard to beat back a beast that is always growing new tentacles. In Western Michigan, as the nights lengthen and temperatures drop, it is becoming harder still, both for people living outdoors, addicted to so many drugs, and those who minister to them.

Soon, the red wagon won’t be able to budge on snow-covered trails. On those days, the Kalamazoo Harm Reduction workers will instead load their safe supplies onto sleds, and set out for the woods."
"New Gene Editing Treatment Cuts Dangerous Cholesterol in Small Study
The trial involved only 10 patients, but it suggests cholesterol can be permanently reduced with a single treatment for patients at risk of heart disease.

The handful of patients had severe heart disease that had caused chest pain and heart attacks. After trying available cholesterol-lowering medications, they could not get their cholesterol as low as cardiologists recommended.

So they volunteered for an experimental cholesterol-lowering treatment using gene editing that was unlike anything tried in patients before.

The result, reported Sunday by the company Verve Therapeutics of Boston at a meeting of the American Heart Association, showed that the treatment appeared to reduce cholesterol levels markedly in patients and that it appeared to be safe.

The trial involved only 10 patients, with an average age of 54. Each had a genetic abnormality, familial hypercholesterolemia, that affects around one million people in the United States. But the findings could also point the way for millions of other patients around the world who are contending with heart disease, which remains a leading cause of death. In the United States alone, more than 800,000 people have heart attacks each year.

And while more trials in a broader range of patients will need to be carried out, gene editing experts and cardiologists said the treatment had the potential to transform preventive cardiology.

“Even for seasoned veterans of this field like myself, this is a day we will look back on,” said Fyodor D. Urnov, a gene editor at the Innovative Genomics Institute in Berkeley, Calif. “I see today as crossing a Rubicon, in a good way. This is not a small step. It is a leap into new territory.”

Impressed with the data and the potential it shows, the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly paid $60 million to collaborate with Verve Therapeutics and opted to acquire additional rights to Verve’s programs for an additional $250 million. If the editing continues to look promising, Eli Lilly expects to help with larger studies.

“Until now, we thought of gene editing as a treatment we should reserve for very rare diseases where there is no other treatment,” said Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, Eli Lilly’s chief scientific and medical officer. “But if we can make gene editing safe and widely available, why not go after a more common disease?”

The new study was led by Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, chief executive of Verve. Patients received a single infusion of microscopic lipid nanoparticles containing within them a molecular factory to edit a single gene in the liver, the site of cholesterol synthesis. The gene, PCSK9, raises levels of LDL cholesterol, the bad kind. The plan was to block it.

The little lipid spheres were carried through the blood directly to the liver. They entered liver cells and opened up, revealing two molecules. One instructs DNA to make a gene editing tool, and the other is a guide to take the editing tool to the gene that needs editing.

The treatment “is almost like science fiction,” said Dr. Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology, who was not involved in the trial.

The gene editing tool acts like a pencil and an eraser. The eraser wipes out one letter of the target gene, and the pencil writes in a new one, turning off PCSK9.

The goal: a single cholesterol-lowering treatment that results in lifelong protection from heart disease.

Patients received varying doses. LDL levels in the three who received the highest doses fell by 39 to 55 percent — enough to get them toward their cholesterol goal.

In the small study, those who received the higher doses had flulike symptoms for a few hours. Two patients had serious adverse events that the study’s independent data safety and monitoring board deemed a result of their underlying severe heart disease. The board advised the researchers not to stop the study.

One had a fatal cardiac arrest five weeks after receiving the infusion. An autopsy showed that several of his coronary arteries were blocked.

The other patient had a heart attack the day after the infusion. It turned out that he had been having chest pain before receiving the infusion but had not reported it. If the investigators had known, he would not have received the treatment.

In a way, the treatment is a culmination of studies that began a decade ago when researchers discovered rare but healthy individuals with cholesterol levels that seemed impossibly low. The reason was that their PCSK9 gene was mutated and no longer functioned. As a result, these people were protected from heart disease.

That led to the development of antibodies to block the gene. Patients inject themselves with the antibodies once a week. Then came a twice-yearly RNA injection that prevents PCSK9 from being made.

It seemed possible that those treatments, as well as statins for those whose cholesterol is more easily controlled, could help solve the heart disease problem.

But heart disease persists as a killer. Even after people are diagnosed with heart disease, less than 60 percent of all patients take a statin. Only a quarter take one of the more effective, high-intensity statins, Dr. Gulati said.

“Patients take it initially, and then they forget or decide they don’t need it,” she explained. “That happens more than you’d think.”

Dr. Michelle O’Donoghue, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said that because patients so often do not take their pills or injections, “there is a lot of interest, through gene editing, of a one and done — a single treatment and a lifetime response.”

Family history was the inspiration for Dr. Kathiresan at Verve Therapeutics. His uncle and grandmother died of heart attacks. His father had a heart attack at age 54. And then, on Sept. 12, 2012, his 42-year-old brother, Senthil, returned from a run dizzy and sweaty. He was having a heart attack. He died nine days later.

At that moment, Dr. Kathiresan said, he vowed to find a way to prevent what had happened to his brother from happening to anyone else.

Of course, even if gene editing works, applying it to young people with heart risk is well into the future. But, Dr. Gulati said, early gene editing of younger patients with genetically high cholesterol levels might prevent arteries from hardening.

“It could be an incredible medicine,” she said.

All this depends on success and safety of the gene editing and on its effects lasting. The first patient was treated just six months ago. But a previous study in monkeys lasted two and a half years, and the results of the gene editing persisted.

Dr. Urnov, who said he has a genetic risk for heart disease, is optimistic for himself and his 6-year-old daughter.

“I honestly cannot wait for this medicine to become available for heart disease prevention,” he said. “I love the idea of having gene editing as a vaccine for the prevention of heart disease.”"
"The Bodily Indignities of the Space Life
The race is on to put hotels in space and neighborhoods on the moon. Here’s some of what we know about how Earthlings fare beyond the safety of our home world.

As an incubator of life, Earth has a lot going for it, something we often fail to appreciate fully from within its nurturing bounds. Merely sending probes and rovers to the moon and Mars won’t do. For various reasons — adventure! apocalypse! commerce! — we insist upon taking our corporeal selves off-world too. Multiple private companies have announced plans to put hotels in space soon. NASA is aiming to 3-D-print lunar neighborhoods within a couple of decades. And while it will probably take longer than that to build and populate an outpost on Mars, preparations are being made: This summer, four NASA crew members began a 378-day stay in simulated Martian housing at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

When you look at the renderings of these cozy dwellings, it’s easy to lose sight of how hostile space is to Earthlings. As a reminder, consider what would happen if you found yourself in low Earth orbit or on Mars or the moon without a spacesuit on. You would pass out from a lack of oxygen within a matter of seconds, a condition known as hypoxia, and die soon thereafter. In the brief meantime, all the gases inside your body, including any air still in your lungs, would expand in the absence of external pressure. Depressurization would also cause your internal fluids to bubble. Not because they’re heating up, but because they are transmogrifying into their gaseous state.

The temperature wouldn’t be much of a problem, at least, even though thermometers in low Earth orbit produce readings from minus 85 degrees to 257 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on whether they are in shadow or in light. Space, as a near vacuum, has very little mass to conduct heat to or away from you, so you are not likely to feel instantly hot or cold.

While hypoxia is potentially a real threat should your space vessel or extraterrestrial habitat leak, it’s a manageable one (assuming you haven’t leaped naked out of your space capsule or off-world dwelling). But two other major challenges confront our fragile bodies when we leave our planet, neither of which has been entirely solved yet, even indoors: variable gravity and radiation.

Gravity is determined by the mass of objects and their distance from one another. Because Earth is so big, it is impossible, while on it, to escape its gravity for any serious length of time. As a result, we don’t know very much about what our lives would be like without — or under some diminished influence of — this omnipresent attraction. On the moon and on Mars, which are smaller than our world, the gravitational tug will be much less: a sixth and a third, respectively, of what it is here.

Conversely, radiation exposure intensifies with elevation, because there’s less atmosphere above you to block it. And you incur a much larger dose if you get beyond the protective bubble of Earth’s ozone and magnetosphere, the magnetic field that stretches roughly 40,000 miles out at its most compressed point. The solar and galactic radiation that washes over Mars, which at its closest is 34 million miles away, will potentially be 700 times as great as what passes through our magnetic defenses. Space travelers beyond low Earth orbit will also be bombarded with high-energy atomic nuclei from exploding stars throughout the galaxy, which are normally deflected by the magnetosphere from reaching the surface of our planet; those particles are so heavy and moving so fast that they penetrate spaceships, spacesuits and skin, banging into other particles in their path and damaging any attendant cells in ways researchers are only beginning to understand.

So far, most of what we know about the effects on the human body of these threats comes from astronauts in low Earth orbit, and because safety is a paramount concern, we don’t send many of them up there, and we don’t let them stay for long when we do. Six months is the average length of a visit to the International Space Station, and fewer than 300 people have made the 250-mile voyage.

While that collective experience is enough to have taught us how the body responds when gravity’s pull is substantially reduced, the magnetosphere still shields the I.S.S., and only the 24 astronauts who flew in the Apollo program have gone beyond it. (The moon orbits an average of more than 238,000 miles away.) Though these two dozen astronauts spent little more than a week at a time without its protection, they have died of cardiovascular disease at a rate four to five times as high as that of their counterparts who stayed in low Earth orbit or never entered orbit at all, which suggests that exposure to cosmic radiation might have damaged their arteries, veins and capillaries.

We can’t send people to Mars, or to live on the moon, until we can be reasonably confident that they’ll survive getting and residing there. But the space-based medical science needed to make that possible has been hindered by small sample sizes that aren’t representative of the general population. (All of the Apollo astronauts were white men born between 1928 and 1936.) Space tourism, though, promises to offer opportunities to study the effects of radiation and low gravity on a much broader demographic than “really well-selected superpeople,” as Dorit Donoviel, the director of the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) at the Baylor College of Medicine, describes those who have historically qualified to leave the planet. “Old, young, pre-existing health conditions — we are starting to gather a knowledge base that in the future will be essential even for NASA,” Donoviel told me, “because we have to learn about the edge cases to really understand what is going on in our bodies to adapt to a hostile environment. You don’t learn as much from people who are healthy. It’s when people get sick that you understand how people get sick and how to prevent it.”

Epidemiologists face the same predicament on Earth: Before they can figure out how to protect the population, they must wait for harm to come to enough people to expose the causes. As less-rigorous medical screening allows more tourists to reach space, the chances increase significantly that someone will get hurt or have a health emergency there. Aerospace medicine is one of three specialties certified by the American Board of Preventive Medicine, because surgeons for a given flight tend to be stuck on the ground; they have to optimize the health of their patients and ward off potential disasters before departure. The problem is, they can’t know what those disasters will be until they occur. Which means that, as with every expedition into the unknown, at some point some intrepid or desperate souls are just going to have to blast off and see what happens.

Scientists once predicted that we couldn’t live in the absence of Earth’s gravity. Without this still-barely-understood force pulling us downward, how would we swallow? Wouldn’t our tongues loll back into our throats? Wouldn’t we choke on our own saliva? And if we survived those perils, wouldn’t escalating pressure in our skulls kill us after a week or so? But when Yuri Gagarin returned from his single, 108-minute orbit around our world in 1961, humanity’s first trip beyond the mesosphere, he proved that our internal musculature could maintain our vital functions in conditions of weightlessness. He ate and drank up there without difficulty. Technically, he hadn’t escaped Earth’s influence; to orbit is to free-fall toward the ground without ever hitting it, and he was in a condition known as microgravity. This felt, he reported, “like hanging horizontally on belts, as if in a suspended state,” a circumstance passingly familiar to anyone who has been on a roller coaster or jumped off a diving board. Gagarin said he got used to it. “There were no bad sensations,” he added.

Either Gagarin was fibbing, or he had a strong stomach. Initially, many space travelers puke, or at least feel motion-sick — space-adaptation syndrome, or S.A.S., is what such nausea, headache and vomiting are called outside our atmosphere. “It’s the same as sitting in the back of the car in childhood, reading something with your head down,” says Jan Stepanek, director of the aerospace-medicine program at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. “It’s a mismatch of what the eyes are seeing and what the inner ear is telling you.” Only in this case, that mismatched perception is a result of the organs and hairs of the vestibular system floating free without their usual gravitational signals. You acclimate eventually. In fact, researchers only learned about the prevalence of S.A.S. symptoms in the 1970s, when they heard Skylab astronauts talking about it with one another over a hot mic. Astronauts, it turns out, are not ideal subjects for medical study, because they are notoriously stoic and unforthcoming about any symptom that might ground them.

On Earth, your body maintains your blood pressure such that enough oxygen reaches your organs and waste is ferried away. One of the biggest oxygen users — your brain — is positioned above your heart for much of the time you are awake. But microgravity suddenly stops pulling blood downward into your legs, just as lying down or getting into a pool does, except more so. That lets blood collect in the upper body, triggering pressure sensors in your heart and the carotid vessels of your neck, which then send hormonal instructions to urinate more and decrease blood production. (This is why you often feel the need to pee shortly after climbing into bed or sinking into a body of water.) On our planet, that’s usually enough to reduce your blood pressure and rebalance the system.

In microgravity, however, the blood volume above your neck will most likely still be too high, at least for a while. This can affect the eyes and optic nerves, sometimes causing permanent vision problems for astronauts who stay in space for months, a condition called spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome. It also causes fluid to accumulate in nearby tissues, giving you a puffy face and congested sinuses. As with a bad cold, the process inhibits nerve endings in the nasal passages, meaning you can’t smell or taste very well. (The nose plays an important role in taste.) The I.S.S. galley is often stocked with wasabi and hot sauce.

These sensory deficits can be helpful in some respects, though, because the I.S.S. tends to smell like body odor or farts. You can’t shower, and microgravity prevents digestive gases from rising out of the stew of other juices in your stomach and intestines, making it hard to belch without barfing. Because the gas must exit somehow, the frequency and volume (metric and decibel) of flatulence increases.

Other metabolic processes are similarly disturbed. Urine adheres to the bladder wall rather than collecting at the base, where the growing pressure of liquid above the urethra usually alerts us when the organ is two-thirds full. “Thus, the bladder may reach maximum capacity before an urge is felt, at which point urination may happen suddenly and spontaneously,” according to “A Review of Challenges & Opportunities: Variable and Partial Gravity for Human Habitats in L.E.O.,” or low Earth orbit. This is a report that came out last year from the authors Ronke Olabisi, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at the University of California, Irvine, and Mae Jemison, a retired NASA astronaut. Sometimes the bladder fills but doesn’t empty, and astronauts need to catheterize themselves.

The longer astronauts stay in microgravity, the more they change. Because they don’t need to support any weight, bones and muscles begin to atrophy — much faster than they do in advanced age on Earth. Bone density in the hips and spine can decrease by 1 to 2 percent per month in space, compared with 0.5 to 1 percent per year in elderly Earthlings. The calcium that leaches from the bones is expelled in urine, increasing the risk of kidney stones. Muscle mass ebbs, too: Astronauts must exercise vigorously for more than two hours a day to keep in decent shape. (They also must constantly dab their skin with a towel while doing so, to prevent their sweat from beading and floating into colleagues or equipment.) The discs between their spinal vertebrae spread farther apart — astronauts grow taller, but their lower backs hurt. The body’s sensors that on Earth raise our blood pressure when we stand up from lying down, so that we don’t faint, grow lazy with disuse. This degeneration, along with reduced muscle mass, is why astronauts must be carried from their capsules when they return to terra firma after a long mission.

The body recalibrates to normal. But protracted stays in microgravity (the current record, 437 days, was set by the Russian astronaut Valeri Polyakov in 1995) make for painful recoveries. After 340 days in space, Scott Kelly, a NASA veteran of three previous shorter missions, described the period immediately following his return as “much, much worse” than those of earlier trips: “All of my joints and all of my muscles are protesting the crushing pressure of gravity,” he wrote in his 2017 memoir, “Endurance.” (Legend has it that Polyakov, for his part, strolled out of his capsule unfazed, bummed a cigarette from a friend and started smoking.) Of course, “recovery” in this case — in every case, so far — means reacclimating to Earth’s pull. But what if you never come back and, instead, stay in orbit or on the moon or Mars for the rest of your life?

If you spin a bucket of water around your head fast enough, the water doesn’t spill out. The same physics underpin most plans for creating what is colloquially referred to as artificial gravity. In those scenarios, the space travelers are the water. The tricky part is that the speed at which you spin them must be faster the closer they get to the axis. In other words, you can have either a gigantic spacecraft that rotates slowly or a small one that rotates rapidly. Engineering and transporting such an apparatus into low Earth orbit has so far not been a major priority for government agencies. It’s much easier and cheaper to give astronauts tools to manage their weightlessness.

But just because NASA hasn’t used spinning vessels to simulate gravity doesn’t mean it’s not possible, says Rhonda Stevenson, the chief executive of Above Space. Once it raises the necessary funding, her company plans to put a small luxury hotel into orbit within five years and have a larger facility operational within another 10 years. In renderings, these establishments look like giant gears with rooms in their cogs. “Folks don’t realize where we are right now and how technologically advanced we are today,” she told me.

Stevenson’s priorities, like those of other space-tourism operators, are oriented toward fun and comfort, not forbearance and science. Astronauts never complain, but paying guests love an excuse to leave a one-star review. (Especially when they’ll be shelling out millions for a weekend stay.) In other words, there must be amenities and flush toilets (a contraption whose evolution was also guided by gravity). “Nobody wants to go up there and be lonely and eat algae paste and crickets,” Stevenson says. “That just doesn’t sound like a good time.”

Eventually such wealthy vacationers will want somewhere to go — a space mall, a mini-golf course — and they’ll want cosmopolitan cuisine. Stevenson and others predict that commercial parks, factories and farms will all be built in space to meet their demands.

The hospitality industry is not the only one with space aspirations. Chemistry and drug discovery might thrive there: Crystals, like those used in pharmaceuticals, grow bigger and more symmetrically in microgravity. There are ambitions to mine the moon for rare metals. Solar-energy production could flourish in the absence of weather. And astrobotany, which will be needed to supply space settlements with fresh food, could eventually grow crops and send them back to Earth. In one experiment, wheat plants grew 10 percent taller in microgravity.

When that day comes, whether you’re in space working or vacationing, tuning your gravity could become part of your 9-to-5, like adjusting your thermostat. You might spend your workday in microgravity. Then you might go for a jog or just rest in 1 g. Maybe as you age and your joints start aching, you move to rooms in 0.75 g, where gravity is tempered just enough to put the spring back in your step. Senior living — in space!

Even if gravity doesn’t prove quite so easy to supply as envisioned, weightlessness would mostly be just an inconvenience for the few hours it takes to get into low Earth orbit or the few days’ flight to the moon. But getting to Mars or back again will, at least at first, most likely require living in microgravity for more than a year. This raises physical concerns: Will those astronauts be able to stand up when they arrive? If they can stand, will they pass out? If they pass out, will they break a bone? And if they break a bone, will it heal as it would on Earth?

Researchers understand even less about astronauts’ neurological states and whether cognition is affected by the pressure that fluids shifting headward put on the brain. “Few of the NASA astronauts want to volunteer to stick a needle in their brain or eye to measure pressure while in space,” Donoviel says. “It’s a risk. And they are afraid we might find something that might prevent them for medical reasons from being able to fly. We’ve had this experiment on the books for years.”

Researchers are hoping that commercial-spaceflight passengers will be more amenable to volunteering for experiments, like having a new kind of pressure transducer surgically implanted inside their skull in the months before takeoff. If the device works as expected, it will answer longstanding questions about the impacts of microgravity inside the cranium. And it might also lead to insights that could help parents and doctors treat babies with hydrocephalus, a neurological disorder caused by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in ventricles deep within the brain.

Scott Kelly’s mission on the I.S.S., nearly a year long, was designed to learn what might happen to astronauts during a flight to Mars. It took advantage of a unique scientific opportunity: Kelly has an identical twin brother, Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut and now a senator from Arizona. While Scott Kelly went to space, a genetic replica of him (or close to it) stayed behind; when he returned, researchers compared the two men at a molecular level to see what had changed in Scott but not in Mark. Soon we might be able to do this kind of experiment by using stem cells from an astronaut’s blood to grow mini-organs that can be exposed to high levels of radiation or microgravity in space, which should show how the astronaut’s actual organs would react to off-world living. “Our thinking was, in the future, each astronaut could give us a few milliliters of blood, and we could make a platform for each individual,” Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic, a professor of biomedical engineering and medical sciences at Columbia University, told me.

Space appeared to remodel Scott Kelly in subtle but perhaps significant ways. He incurred a small amount of DNA damage, believed to be caused by radiation exposure. (Astronauts’ radiation doses are tracked over their lifetime; if these become too high, they can no longer go to space.) He also experienced epigenetic changes, modifications in how genes are expressed that can be heritable, a feature that helps humans and other creatures preserve useful adaptations without waiting for evolution to do its brutal work. Those alterations, which reverted nearly to their baseline state after Kelly’s return, gave scientists a sense of what genes might be most impacted by lengthier stays in space.

One of the most puzzling changes researchers observed was in his gut microbiome, as the community of bacteria, fungi and viruses that live in the digestive tract is known. The species of bacteria were the same, but their proportions in relation to one another had shifted considerably, probably in part because the food Kelly ate was quite different. Such rearrangements among the micro-organisms could be a cause for concern, because they are involved in digestion, metabolism and immunity, and changes to their composition have been associated with neurological and physiological conditions. Reduced immunity could be especially dangerous in space, where microgravity also appears to cause bacterial cell membranes to thicken and make bacteria more resistant to antibiotics and more likely to cause severe disease.

There will, of course, be surprises out there, some of them sure to be quite unpleasant. Jan Stepanek at the Mayo Clinic points out that scientists once thought blood clots were very unlikely to occur in the absence of Earth’s gravity. But then one appeared. In fact, in a 2019 study, an international group of researchers reported that the blood flow in the jugular veins of six of 11 I.S.S. crew members they monitored had, by around Day 50 in space, either stagnated or reversed direction — and one of the six had a potentially fatal thrombosis with no symptoms. Luckily, physicians had already stocked the I.S.S. with a 40-day emergency supply of anticoagulants, among other medications, just in case.

Space-medicine experts are adept at imagining dire scenarios. “What if somebody develops appendicitis?” says Natacha Chough, an emergency medical physician and professor of aerospace medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch. “If we go to Mars, you can’t pull a U-turn. Do you send a surgeon? What if they are the one who gets appendicitis?” She and other flight surgeons are mindful of the case of a 27-year-old Soviet doctor, Leonid Rogozov, who in 1961 had to give himself an appendectomy at a base that he and a team of 11 others built in Antarctica. He did it by feel, after finding the inverted images in a mirror disorienting. Within two hours, he had removed the infected organ and sutured himself up (a helpful colleague snapped photographs for posterity).

U.T.M.B. often sends trainees in aerospace medicine to practice at a research station in Antarctica — an environment in which doctors may be called upon to perform medical procedures they haven’t performed in many years, with limited supplies. Ronak Shah, director of aerospace medicine at U.T.M.B., puts the quandary this way: “Do you have the tools and support staff to complete those procedures?” Then, referring to the doctor on the original “Star Trek,” he adds, “People often envision that surgical suite that Dr. McCoy had.” In reality, it could cost $10,000 or more per pound to put a payload into orbit, and anything that goes on the spacecraft must earn its place at the expense of something else. There’s a defibrillator and a portable ultrasound on the I.S.S., but no CT scanner or M.R.I. machine.

Major surgery could result in the patient’s insides floating out. Even giving injections in space requires comprehensive planning. Rogozov could at least give himself Novocain. Chough was the flight surgeon for NASA astronauts on the I.S.S. when the coronavirus vaccine became available, and she had to decide whether to send it up on a routine resupply flight. The decision involved weighing the protection of the astronauts when they landed on Earth, conceivably with compromised immunity, versus considerations about how to get liquid into a syringe, how any side effects could make astronauts incapable of performing their duties, how to keep the vaccine cold enough and how to dose it without wasting any — an ethical conundrum in the days when there was not enough to go around on Earth. Ultimately, Chough decided they would have to wait until their return.

It’s a truism of our species that the moment we encounter a new and challenging environment — a mountaintop, say, or an airplane bathroom — we feel compelled to find out what will happen if we engage in coitus there. Naturally, then, as soon as the first billionaires check into the first space hotels, they will be thinking about becoming the inaugural members of the 250-Mile-High Club. This raises the issue: There really aren’t rules for medical experimentation in space that cover tourists’ behavior. “If someone wants to have sex in space or have a baby in space, there’s no framework to provide guidelines,” Dorit Donoviel says. “We need to make sure commercial spaceflight provides opportunity for good science. The last thing we want to do is have it turn into the Wild West and do stupid things that could get people hurt or create bad press and turn people against space travel. That damages the whole industry.”

So should space travelers choose abstinence until a formal entity declares space sex safe? Is it possible that this threshold has already been breached? Fewer than 700 people have flown to space so far, and it is often easy to identify who they are in research publications, which can make them reticent about details that might satisfy behaviorists. In short, says Simon Dubé, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, “we know very little about the intimacy and sexuality of astronauts.”

But we do know some basics. “There are good indications that erection and lubrication are not inhibited in space,” Dubé says. And it appears that microgravity doesn’t subject contraceptives to additional side effects.

‘If we take Earth with us, are we going to stall evolution?’
There are concerns about reproduction, however, that will have to be addressed if our species is ever to take up permanent residence somewhere else besides Earth. For the most part, scientists have studied aspects of procreation in space only in animals, including fruit flies, frogs, newts, geckos, aquatic crustaceans, quails, rats, mice and, intriguingly, rams. While producing and developing healthy embryos in space can be done, it clearly comes with considerable risks. Radiation exposure damages DNA and can cause infertility and sterility in adults, for example. Exposed embryos and fetuses appear more likely to have growth and cognitive delays, birth defects and higher rates of newborn mortality.

Dubé is worried most of all about the psychological effects of intercourse (or a lack thereof) in space. “What I want to draw people’s attention to is that we are going to try to enact sexuality in all its complexity in a very small, remote, isolated, very small space, with limited partners who are people you work with and depend on.” Historically, in analogous situations, like military basic training, this has proved disastrous, mostly for women. “I’m much more worried about the next morning, after people have sex, how it’s going to affect the crew dynamic,” Dubé told me, “rather than, Are people going to be able to have sex or masturbate in the space station?”

The potential adverse health effects of loneliness and isolation in space have also been under-studied but will most likely become more significant the longer a mission lasts. Being in space is like the pandemic lockdowns many people experienced in 2020, except you can’t open a window or take a walk outdoors. And the farther you get from Earth, the more lag time there is between when you send a message and when your loved one back home receives it. (On Mars, the wait might be 20 minutes.)

In 2014, NASA issued a report, “Examining Psychosocial Well-Being and Performance in Isolated, Confined and Extreme Environments,” that considered data from submarines, underground bunkers and polar expeditions. It also detailed how career competition and differences in personality, values, culture and language derailed a 105-day I.S.S. simulation in 1999, in which a crew occupied connected hyperbaric chambers: “A physical fight broke out among two of the crew members, a sexual-harassment incident was reported and one protesting crew member withdrew from the study,” the report’s authors wrote. “In the context of spaceflight, where individual escape or mission termination is rarely an option,” they predicted, “events such as this will certainly place individual psychosocial health and performance, as well as mission success, in extreme jeopardy.”

Fortunately, the polar teams seemed to have fared somewhat better, with Antarctic groups that spent the winter there enjoying many aspects of their removal from society, including “excitement over experiencing the unknown; free time to self-improve, exercise and think; and the opportunity to remove oneself from daily hassles and negative aspects of life on Earth.”

Will we miss Earth, those of us who leave it? If we yearn to come back home, can we? It seems miraculous that, over billions of years, our planetary circumstances enabled protozoa to evolve into people. But really, we are just “a series of elegant sensors,” Jennifer Fogarty, the chief scientific officer at Baylor’s space-health institute, told me. Our bodies, obsessed with hoarding the energy we require to stay alive, ruthlessly divest themselves of any features and capacities that are going unused without, so to speak, a backward glance.

“If we do think all the way out to colonization,” Fogarty wonders, “would those people who had a sustained presence there, would their body operate differently and be less compatible with Earth?” That wouldn’t necessarily be bad; it would mean those people were better suited to the moon or Mars. But adaptation is a zero-sum game. “The concern would be if some of those capabilities are lost over generations,” she went on. “Do we bring Earth with us? Create artificial gravity? If we take Earth with us, are we going to stall evolution? Or do we let people start with an adaptive response, and maybe it’s hard for people multiple generations later to come back?”

In other words, are we, in some essential sense, Earthlings, incapable of fully casting off the biology our home planet designed for us? Or are we — could we become — the extraterrestrials we’ve so long fantasized about? It seems that, one way or another, we’re committed to finding out."
"The Only People Who Understand What a Caregiver Goes Through
Mentoring programs bring together those just starting to care for family members with dementia and those who have been coping for some time.

On Thursday mornings, Julia Sadtler and Debora Dunbar log onto Zoom to talk about caring for their husbands with Alzheimer’s disease, in hourlong conversations that are usually informative, sometimes emotional and always supportive.

Both men are patients at Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia, which began this mentorship program for caregivers in September. By design, the two women are at different stages.

Dr. Dunbar, a nurse-practitioner who lives in Wallingford, Pa., is younger, at 61, but has coped with caregiving for far longer: Her husband, Jeffrey Draine, 60, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s in 2017. “It’s something I’ve developed expertise in,” she said.

Philip Sadtler, 80, received his diagnosis just two years ago, so his wife has long lists of questions about what lies ahead. How will she know when Philip should stop driving? How can she handle the guilt of leaving him at home sometimes while she volunteers or sees friends? How long can the couple, who live in Berwyn, Pa., continue traveling to California to visit their daughter and her family?

“The sense of being overwhelmed can be crushing,” said Ms. Sadtler, 81, a retired school admissions director. She also participates in a Penn Memory caregiver support group, but felt drawn to the mentorship’s one-on-one nature. “I knew that someone who’s been down this road would be a great help,” she said.

“Caregiving in general is hard, but caregiving for a person with dementia is harder,” said Felicia Greenfield, Penn Memory’s executive director. “Caregivers report high rates of anxiety and depression. They have a harder time attending to their own health. Things change socially; their friends don’t understand or come around anymore.”

It’s also, she added, a financially draining and physically demanding role, often lasting for years, continuing even if a family member moves into assisted living or a nursing home. The center’s Caring Collective mentorship matches newcomers to the challenge with those who have walked the walk.

A new study documents the extent of that burden. Using data from the longitudinal federal Health and Retirement Study, a University of Michigan team compared about 2,400 older adults (average age: 75) who developed dementia during a two-year follow-up with 2,400 others who did not. The researchers matched the groups for health and disability, demographic characteristics, economic status and health care use.

“They were very similar people at baseline, so we could demonstrate the impact of dementia,” said HwaJung Choi, a health economist and the lead author. “We were surprised at the huge change over two years.”

At the start, people in both groups received about 12 hours of unpaid care a month from family and friends. After two years, the control group showed little change, but in the group with dementia, “the care hours for family members increased dramatically,” to 45 hours a month, Dr. Choi said.

That figure refers only to hands-on help with so-called activities of daily living — bathing, dressing, using the toilet. Taking into account tasks such as shopping, meal preparation and handling finances, unpaid caregivers spent 27 hours assisting the control group each month, compared with 76 hours for the group with dementia.

Only about 3 percent of either group used a nursing facility, including rehab stays, at the start; over two years, more than one in five of those with dementia had used or moved into a nursing facility. About 47 percent of the people with dementia had at least one hospital stay, versus 35 percent of those without dementia.

Moreover, largely because of the expense of long-term care, those who had developed dementia lost more than 60 percent of their median wealth over a longer eight-year follow-up. “It’s a devastating problem for individuals and families, and also for society in general,” Dr. Choi said.

None of that will come as a surprise to families caring for people with dementia.

“I remembered how absolutely terrified I was at the beginning,” said Susan Jewett, 76, who first proposed the mentoring idea to Penn Memory after her husband’s death in 2020.

Her pitch: “Maybe I could be useful to someone who is earlier in the process.”

Mentoring can benefit both parties, said Justin McBride, a senior administrator at Duet: Partners in Health and Aging, which began a similar program in Phoenix in 2016. “We hear all the time that supporting another person in need gives mentors a sense of purpose,” he said. “It helps them make sense of their own journey.”

The relatively low cost of such volunteer programs could make them replicable in many locations. They operate on a small scale, however. Duet’s program, which like Penn’s involves screening and training mentors, has about 20 pairs enrolled.

It requires a six-month commitment, but most mentoring relationships last a year or two. Penn’s newer Caring Collective, requiring a three-month commitment, has enrolled 20 mentors and 40 mentees.

Larger organizations like the Alzheimer’s Association also work to support dementia patients and caregivers. Its free 24/7 helpline responded to 215,000 contacts in the 2023 fiscal year, and its online community called ALZConnected has about 10,000 active members. It conducts more than 27,000 caregiver support groups nationally.

Still, support programs aim to keep family caregivers on the job — a job that may simply grow too demanding, especially since many (spouses, in particular) are themselves quite old, with their own health problems and limited ability to afford paid help.

“People in government need to hear about what’s going on,” Ms. Greenfield said.

A new federal initiative is on the horizon. Medicare plans to fund an eight-year model program called GUIDE, to provide care coordination, education and support; it will include payment for respite services, allowing caregivers a break from their responsibilities.

Workplaces can also play a role, especially for adult children who are working while also caring for aging parents. While employers estimate that 35 percent of their workforces are caregivers, the actual proportion is 56 percent, according to a recent Bank of America report.

Those workers need policies like leaves of absence, flexible scheduling and counseling. Yet a 2021 report for the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers found that most employers didn’t offer them.

Mentoring provides a different kind of support, but one that early participants say has proved uniquely valuable. Mary Perkins, 76, who cares for her husband at their home in Lewes, Del., has been talking regularly with Susan Jewett.

Her husband, Wes Perkins, 82, has vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s; at one point, when he required institutionalization for dementia psychosis, his care became particularly difficult. “I was a mess,” Ms. Perkins said. “I needed to talk with someone who understood.”

Even more than advice on specific programs and strategies, Ms. Perkins said, she benefited from hearing Ms. Jewett’s own story. “I looked at her face on FaceTime, and I saw hope,” Ms. Perkins said. “I knew she’d gone through hell and she was surviving, even thriving. If she could live through it, I could, too.”

Mr. Perkins is back at home now, taking medication to control his symptoms and enrolled in a local PACE program, a comprehensive state and federal effort that provides some paid home care. The couple can take walks together, go out for breakfast, drive to the beach. “We still have good times,” Ms. Perkins said. “It’s better than I ever thought it could be.”

At some later date, she plans to become a mentor herself."
"Gonorrhea Is Becoming Drug Resistant. Scientists Just Found a Solution.
A new antibiotic, zoliflodacin, is as effective as the current standard of care. Its creation may hasten the arrival of other needed antibiotics.

The News
A new antibiotic, the first to be developed in decades, can cure gonorrhea infections at least as effectively as the most powerful current treatment, a large clinical trial has found. The drug, zoliflodacin, is taken as a single dose, and it has not yet been approved for use in any country.

But the drug was developed in a way that experts hope will make it widely accessible and will prevent widespread drug resistance.

Why It Matters: Gonorrhea is a major global problem.
With more than 82 million new infections recorded worldwide in 2020, gonorrhea is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. The pathogen, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, spreads through sexual contact to the genitals, rectum and throat.

About half of infected people show no symptoms, but in others gonorrhea can lead to painful joints and burning urination. Left untreated, it can cause infertility and sterility, blindness in infants or even death.

Over the years, the bacterium has found a way to dodge nearly every available antibiotic. It has become resistant to azithromycin and is increasingly resistant to another antibiotic called ceftriaxone, which is now the standard of care.

The most powerful defense combines a shot of ceftriaxone with azithromycin, but some evidence hints that gonorrhea is evolving to sidestep even that treatment.

Zoliflodacin is a new type of antibiotic, boosting hopes that the bacterium will remain susceptible to it for a long time.

“This is a new drug, genuinely solving a problem that really needs to be solved,” said Dr. Manica Balasegaram, executive director of Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership, or G.A.R.D.P., a nonprofit that shepherded the drug’s development.

“This doesn’t happen often,” he added.

The Back Story: A clever way to create new antibiotics.
Pharmaceutical companies have largely abandoned antibiotic development as unprofitable. The development of zoliflodacin represents a new model: G.A.R.D.P., which is funded by many Group of 20 countries and the European Union, developed the drug in collaboration with an American pharmaceutical company called Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics.

The nonprofit sponsored the Phase 3 trial of the drug. In exchange, it holds the license to sell the antibiotic in about 160 countries while Innoviva retains marketing rights for high-income countries.

“I’ll go out on a limb and say that’s probably the only way in which we develop antibiotics going forward, because the old model is simply not going to work,” said Ramanan Laxminarayan, a senior research scholar at Princeton University who chairs the G.A.R.D.P. board.

The agreement ensures that the antibiotic will be available and affordable for people in low- and middle-income countries.

“Nobody’s making a boatload of money off treatment of gonorrhea, especially when you’re using a single dose of an oral antibiotic,” said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

“This is a path forward to solve the dilemma of getting pathways for products that don’t guarantee profits,” Dr. Marrazzo said.

What We Don’t Know: The drug may not cure all cases.
The clinical trial enrolled 930 people in five countries, the largest so far for a gonorrhea treatment. It showed that zoliflodacin was as effective at treating gonorrhea as the combination of ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

The trial was designed to test how well zoliflodacin works in the urogenital tract. Based on previous research, the drug is unlikely to be as effective in the throat and rectum, said Dr. Marrazzo. But “this will give us a pathway to at least address very common infections, particularly in women, worldwide,” she said.

The drugmakers were more sanguine. The numbers of throat and rectal infections were too small to produce firm results, “but we’re very encouraged because they were comparable” to the urogenital tract, said Dr. Margaret Koziel, Innoviva’s chief medical officer.

What’s Next: Scientists will try to prevent resistance.
The more widely a drug is used, the greater the chances that pathogens will find ways to defend against it. In studies, zoliflodacin appears to be effective against a wide range of resistant strains of gonorrhea.

But that does not preclude the possibility that the bacterium may yet evolve to dodge the drug. The partnership’s agreement minimizes that chance: The nonprofit plans to manage how the drug is distributed, and to see that it is used only to treat gonorrhea."
"At Least 2 Million Children Have Lost Medicaid Insurance This Year
Many of the children were eligible for federal aid, experts said, but errors have been common as states “unwind” assistance from earlier in the coronavirus pandemic.

At least two million low-income children have lost health insurance since the end of a federal policy that guaranteed coverage through Medicaid earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, according to new analyses by researchers at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families and KFF, a health policy research organization.

The figures, which are likely a significant undercount, represent one of the fastest and most dramatic ruptures in the American safety net since Medicaid went into law in 1965, experts say. Many of the children were qualified for federal assistance but lost it because of bureaucratic mistakes, such as missing paperwork or errors by state officials.

It is not clear how many of these children have found new coverage in the more than seven months since the Medicaid rolls began shrinking, but at least one million are likely to still be uninsured, said Joan Alker, the executive director of the Georgetown center and a research professor at the university’s McCourt School of Public Policy.

The trend is accelerating: In the coming weeks, she said, new state numbers will probably show that three million children have lost coverage.

“This is an unprecedented situation,” Ms. Alker said. The unraveling, she added, “has the potential to increase the uninsured rate for children by the largest amount that we’ve seen in decades.”

Federal researchers forecast the crisis, estimating last year that more than five million children would eventually lose their health insurance through Medicaid or the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program as states tried to redetermine eligibility, a process health experts have called “unwinding.”

But the scale and speed of coverage losses among children has surprised even those who anticipated an upheaval. “This is not happening in a vacuum — states have the power to make choices,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. “And they can either stand up for kids or they can basically walk away from them.”

In Lady Lake, Fla., about 50 miles northwest of Orlando, Christina Ragsdale’s children twice lost Medicaid insurance because of what she said were state enrollment errors. Her 13-year-old son, Aaron, went without his A.D.H.D. medication at school until a family member covered the out-of-pocket costs, which ran over $1,000 for a monthlong supply, she said.

“The anxiety, the panic, being overwhelmed, the frustrations in class — there are just so many moving variables when that happens and you don’t have notice,” said Ms. Ragsdale, 38, who has just finished cosmetology school.

She added: “When you can’t help your kids, you feel like you’re failing.”

The number of people with Medicaid coverage rose dramatically earlier in the pandemic. By 2022, researchers estimate, more than half of children in the United States were covered by Medicaid or CHIP, programs that are jointly financed by states and the federal government.

Poverty in America
A Sharp Rise: The poverty rate soared in 2022 in the United States, particularly among children, as living costs rose and many federal pandemic aid programs ended.
Safety Net Barriers: Immigrant children, the fastest-growing group of American youths, have poverty rates more than twice those of other children. The hurdles their families face in getting aid aren’t helping.
A Persistent Problem: Over the past 50 years, there has been no real progress on how to address poverty in the United States. A sociologist offers a new explanation for an intractable problem.
More than 90 million Americans, or more than one-quarter of citizens nationwide, were enrolled in the programs.  Medicaid enrollment has already declined by nearly six million people during the unwinding, according to the Georgetown center.

A significant number of children who no longer qualified for Medicaid were expected to be absorbed into CHIP, which is intended to cover young Americans in families with incomes too high for Medicaid eligibility but too low for private plans.

But the program has not functioned as the refuge that lawmakers and health officials had hoped it would be. Ms. Alker and her colleagues estimate that 21 states with separate CHIP programs had picked up only 87,355 children — after 1.5 million were removed from Medicaid in those states.

Since respiratory illnesses circulate widely in the fall and winter, the insurance coverage losses are happening at a particularly risky time. Even small medical expenses can be prohibitively costly for families of uninsured children, while larger bills can eat up savings.

Parents “are being asked to make a decision between their children’s health care and something else that is a necessity,” said Dr. Valerie Borum Smith, a pediatrician in Tyler, Texas, who treats a large number of patients on Medicaid.

One child she saw went a month without therapy before his Medicaid was reinstated, she said. A mother of two children who had lost Medicaid because of a paperwork error was forced to pay out-of-pocket costs for multiple rounds of antibiotics.

Some Republican governors have defended the unwinding, arguing that Medicaid programs are reverting to their intended shape and scope after enrollments soared earlier in the pandemic.

Over 70 percent of Americans who have lost Medicaid since April did so for procedural reasons, according to KFF. Through official letters and public and private coaxing, the Biden administration has implored state officials to follow federal guidelines and help Medicaid recipients through the process of establishing their eligibility.

Still, some experts say that the federal government, which can halt a state’s unwinding process, has not been aggressive enough with officials in states such as Texas, which has disenrolled more than 700,000 children from Medicaid.

Some children cut off from government-sponsored insurance may have parents with incomes that are too high, or their families may have obtained coverage through plans offered by an employer. Some may have moved to other states, while others are now over 18, the age cutoff.

Still, the rising rate of low-income children without insurance is alarming, especially since many of the newly uninsured likely should not be, experts and officials said in interviews.

“I go to sleep at night thinking about this,” Daniel Tsai, a senior official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in an interview.

He added: “We should not have kids being uninsured without health care, with families worried about how to pay for medication or what to do if your kid needs to go to the emergency department.”

There is some imminent relief for parents. A law passed in December will require that states preserve Medicaid and CHIP coverage for a year for all children starting in January 2024. But children first will need to establish eligibility as part of the current unwinding, Ms. Alker noted.

A week or even a day without health insurance can be precarious for young children. Medicaid and CHIP allow families to visit primary care practices, pay for inhalers or to receive specialty care for developmental needs, for example.

Dr. Eliza Varadi, a pediatrician in Charleston, S.C., said that without Medicaid medications her patients need for asthma and diabetes can cost hundreds of dollars. Families regularly canceled appointments at her practice after realizing their children no longer had health coverage.

In Carlisle, Pa., Rhiannon Hall’s 17-year-old daughter, Kayden, went two months this year without Medicaid, leaving Ms. Hall frightened of potential medical expenses that could have suddenly swallowed her savings.

Before Kayden secured a free CHIP plan, Ms. Hall, a medical records employee at a community health clinic, canceled Kayden’s urgent orthodontist appointments and a regular dental cleaning.

She nearly stopped picking up her daughter’s supply of Depo-Provera shots, used to control an internal bleeding problem. “When it’s gone, you worry every day that something is going to happen,” Ms. Hall said of her daughter’s health insurance.

Kerstin Foor, one of Ms. Hall’s co-workers at the clinic, has a 2-year-old daughter who went without health insurance for several weeks in July before receiving a free CHIP plan. Her daughter suffers from ear infections and allergies, and medication was unaffordable while she was uninsured.

“It makes you feel like you’re not doing your part, because your child should never go without health insurance,” Ms. Foor said. “It made me feel like the worst person in the world.”"
"What to Know About the Sexual Side Effects of Antidepressants
S.S.R.I.s, the most widely prescribed antidepressants, frequently cause sexual problems. Here’s what patients can do about it.

Antidepressants have long been among the most widely prescribed drugs in the U.S. Their popularity only grew at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when many people struggled with depression and anxiety. Some surveys have found a striking rise among adolescents, particularly teenage girls.

For many people, the drugs can be lifesaving or can drastically improve their quality of life.

But many of the most popular antidepressants, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.s, come with sexual side effects. In many cases, the problems caused by the medications can be managed. Here’s what patients should know.

A wide variety of symptoms has been reported.
More than half of patients who take S.S.R.I.s report some problems having sex. They include low levels of sexual desire or arousal, erectile dysfunction, pleasureless or painful orgasms and loss of genital sensitivity.

Many people also report emotional blunting after taking S.S.R.I.s. This may make negative feelings less painful but also make positive feelings less pleasurable.

Don’t be shy about talking to a doctor.
When S.S.R.I.s went on the market in the late 1980s, patients began telling their psychiatrists that they were having sexual problems. Initially, doctors were perplexed: As far as they knew, older antidepressants had never come with these issues. But they had been wrong.

“Only in going back and looking more carefully and gathering more data did we realize that actually those serotonergic drugs, the older ones, also caused sexual dysfunction,” said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, head of the American Psychiatric Association’s research council. Doctors and patients just hadn’t been talking about it, he said.

As S.S.R.I.s boomed in popularity, and social stigmas about discussions of sex eased, researchers began documenting the problem in the scientific literature. But some patients found it easier to talk about than others did. Men were much more likely to report sexual side effects to their doctors than women were, even though women are almost twice as likely to be prescribed antidepressants.

“The charitable interpretation is that we simply have more treatments available for male patients, and so doctors are more likely to ask after things that they feel they can actually help with,” said Tierney Lorenz, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who has studied antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in women. “The significantly less charitable interpretation is that we still live in a very sexist society that doesn’t believe that women should have sexual interest.”

Doctors may first recommend waiting it out.
For some people, the sexual side effects of S.S.R.I.s will show up almost immediately after starting the medications and then resolve. So doctors may suggest waiting four to six months to see whether the sexual effects subside.

But the odds of spontaneous resolution of sexual side effects are low, happening in about 10 to 20 percent of patients who report the symptoms.

Other medications, including other antidepressants, can help.
One common way to manage sexual side effects is to try another S.S.R.I. Research suggests that certain drugs, such as Zoloft and Celexa, come with a higher likelihood of sexual problems. Switching drugs, however, means enduring a trial-and-error period to find what works.

If a patient is otherwise doing well on an S.S.R.I., a doctor may be hesitant to drastically change the drug regimen. Instead, the doctor might recommend adding an additional drug to the mix that could help counteract the sexual side effects.

For example, adding the non-S.S.R.I. antidepressant Wellbutrin, which acts on norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, has been shown to diminish sexual symptoms in many patients, said Dr. Alpert, who is also chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.

For erectile dysfunction, doctors may also suggest adding phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors like Viagra, which acts on the vascular system, he said.

‘Drug holidays’ can help. But be careful.
Another approach that should be used cautiously and under the close supervision of a physician is temporarily stopping the S.S.R.I. or lowering the dose for 24 to 48 hours before having sex.

But for many patients, this isn’t an ideal solution. Planning ahead can be annoying. And withdrawal from S.S.R.I.s can immediately cause other unpleasant symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, insomnia and anxiety. Some doctors are concerned that frequent use of drug holidays may make patients more likely to discontinue the medications altogether, which could lead to worsening mental health problems.

In rare cases, sex problems can persist after stopping the drugs.
A small but vocal group of patients is speaking out about sexual problems that have endured even after they stopped taking S.S.R.I.s. Some have reported low libido and numb genitals persisting for many years.

Though studies are scarce, the risk appears to be low. A recent study estimated that about one in 216 men who discontinued S.S.R.I.s were subsequently prescribed medications for erectile dysfunction, a rate at least three times as high as that among the general population.

But diagnosing this condition is tricky, in part because depression itself can dull sexual responses. Among unmedicated men with depression, 40 percent report a loss of sexual arousal and desire, and 20 percent struggle to reach orgasm."
"After Antidepressants, a Loss of Sexuality
Some patients are speaking up about lasting sexual problems after stopping antidepressants, a poorly understood condition.

Doctors and patients have long known that antidepressants can cause sexual problems. No libido. Pleasureless orgasms. Numb genitals. Well over half of people taking the drugs report such side effects.

Now, a small but vocal group of patients is speaking out about severe sexual problems that have endured even long after they stopped taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the most popular type of antidepressants. The drugs’ effects have been devastating, they said, leaving them unable to enjoy sex or sustain romantic relationships.

“My clitoris feels like a knuckle,” said Emily Grey, a 27-year-old in Vancouver, British Columbia, who took one such drug, Celexa, for depression from age 17 to 23. “It’s not a normal thing to have to come to terms with.”

The safety label on Prozac, one of the most widely prescribed S.S.R.I.s, warns that sexual problems may persist after the drug is discontinued. And health authorities in Europe and Canada recently acknowledged that the medications can lead to lasting sexual issues.

But researchers are only just beginning to quantify how many people have these long-term problems, known as post-S.S.R.I. sexual dysfunction. And the chronic condition remains contested among some psychiatrists, who point out that depression itself can curb sexual desire. Clinical trials have not followed people after they stop the drugs to determine whether such sexual problems stem from the medications.

“I think it’s depression recurring. Until proven otherwise, that’s what it is,” said Dr. Anita Clayton, the chief of psychiatry at the University of Virginia School of Medicine and a leader of an expert group that will meet in Spain next year to formally define the condition.

Dr. Clayton published some of the earliest research showing that S.S.R.I.s come with widespread sexual side effects. She said patients with these problems should talk to their doctors about switching to a different antidepressant or a combination of drugs.

She worries that too much attention on seemingly rare cases of sexual dysfunction after S.S.R.I.s are stopped could dissuade suicidal patients from trying the medications. “I have a really big fear about this,” she said.

By the mid-2000s, the sexual effects of S.S.R.I.s were well recognized. In fact, the drugs so reliably dulled sexual responses that doctors began prescribing them for men with premature ejaculation.

But sexual symptoms that endure after stopping the drugs haven’t received much attention in the medical literature.

In 2006, a handful of cases of persistent genital numbness were reported in Canada and the United States. That same year, a newsletter for the American Psychological Association described emerging data on the lasting sexual effects of the drugs.

“I believe that we have barely begun to appreciate the pervasiveness and complexity of the impact on sexuality of these medications,” Audrey Bahrick, then a psychologist at the University of Iowa, wrote in the article.

In an interview, Dr. Bahrick said she felt an ethical obligation to call attention to the condition because she had experienced it herself.

She started taking Prozac in 1993, when she was 37 and struggling with a difficult job in a new city. Within one day of taking the pill, her clitoris and vagina felt numb. “It was like there was a glove over them — a very, very muffled sensation,” she recalled.

For a while, she said, the trade-off was worth it: The antidepressant made her feel energized and more resilient. But after two years, she stopped taking it for the sake of her relationship. The sexual symptoms persisted, however, and the relationship ended.

“It never occurred to me that this would be something that would in fact, in my life, never resolve,” said Dr. Bahrick, who is now 67.

In the decades since, the use of S.S.R.I.s has soared, especially among teenagers. They are prescribed not only for depression and anxiety, but for a range of other conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, eating disorders and premenstrual symptoms. Yet researchers are still struggling to understand how S.S.R.I.s work, and why the sexual problems are so pervasive.

The drugs target serotonin, an important chemical messenger in the brain as well as other parts of the body. The molecule is involved in blunting sexual responses, including the orgasm reflex that originates in the spinal cord. Serotonin also affects estrogen levels, which in turn can affect arousal.

But depression, too, dulls the sex drive. Among unmedicated men with depression, 40 percent report a loss of sexual arousal and desire, and 20 percent struggle to reach orgasm. Common conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease can also cause sexual problems.

Drug trials rarely look at what happens when medications are stopped. And studying what happens after people get off S.S.R.I.s is particularly challenging because many people never stop taking them.

Given the lack of data, “persistent sexual dysfunction caused by S.S.R.I.s is a hypothesis, not a proven phenomena,” said Dr. Robert Taylor Segraves, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine who has studied the effects of antidepressants on sexuality.

Still, some researchers have found ways to estimate the prevalence of the condition. A recent study in Israel reported that about one in 216 men who discontinued S.S.R.I.s were subsequently prescribed medications for erectile dysfunction, a rate at least three times as high as that among the general population.

And when many patients report similar problems — like the distinctive symptom of genital numbness — the signal should not be dismissed, said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, head of the American Psychiatric Association’s research council.

Some patients who have taken finasteride, which treats hair loss in men, or isotretinoin, an acne medication, have also reported genital numbness and other sexual problems after stopping the medications. That may point to a common biological mechanism, Dr. Alpert said.

“Everything begins with anecdotal reports, and science needs to follow,” he said.

Other researchers are particularly worried about the growing number of young people who start the medications before their sexuality has fully developed.

“People put on these drugs at a young age may just never know who they might otherwise be if they hadn’t been on this drug,” said Yassie Pirani, a counselor in Vancouver.

In a new survey of 6,000 L.G.B.T.Q. young people that has not yet been peer-reviewed, Ms. Pirani and collaborators at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia found that people who had stopped antidepressants were 10 times more likely to report persistent genital numbness than those who had never taken the drugs.

Ms. Pirani described one of her patients, age 33, who had taken S.S.R.I.s from age 11 to her mid-20s. “Her whole sexual history, she could have sex, but she never really felt anything,” Ms. Pirani said.

Some of her patients, she added, wondered for years whether they were asexual before understanding that the medications may have played a role. When they turned to doctors for help, they were often dismissed.

In recent years, many patients have found support for their condition online. About 10,000 people are members of a Reddit group for those with post-S.S.R.I. sexual dysfunction, up from 750 members in 2020. In 2018, dozens of patients and doctors petitioned regulators in Europe and the United States to add warnings about the risk of persistent sexual problems to drug labels, spurring the European Medicines Agency to do so the following year. (A spokeswoman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the agency was still reviewing the petition.)

“We feel very neglected,” said Roy Whaley, a 38-year-old from Somerset, England, who belongs to the PSSD Network, a global advocacy group formed last year.

Mr. Whaley briefly took the antidepressant Citalopram at age 22 to treat his obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sixteen years later, his penis feels almost like it has been injected with a local anaesthetic, he said. He has lost his libido and feels no pleasure from orgasms. At times, he said, this loss of sexuality has made him feel suicidal.

Over the years, doctors have repeatedly suggested that Mr. Whaley’s sexual problems were psychological, according to medical records reviewed by The New York Times. One record from 2009 noted that the Citalopram was “exceptionally unlikely” to be the cause.

His current doctor does believe him, he said, partly because of the statement from European regulators.

For Dr. Bahrick, who has continued to publish research on the topic, the recent recognition of her condition is cold comfort, considering the unknown number of people who have lost a core experience of being human.

“It’s not just numb genitals,” Dr. Bahrick said. “It’s a reorientation to being in the world.”"
"Sore After Working Out? Here’s How to Manage.
Post-exercise stiffness is a part of any fitness regimen, but many treatments don’t address the underlying cause. Here’s what actually works.

Maybe it was an intense spin class that put you over the edge, or reaching for a personal best in the squat. Perhaps it was dancing all night at a wedding reception, using muscles you haven’t worked in years. Whatever the cause, the next day you’re stiff, sore and moving a little slowly.

The reasons the human body becomes sore are surprisingly mysterious, with various theories coming in and out of fashion. The cause of soreness is complex, according to Gene Shirokobrod, a physical therapist and the chief executive of Recharge Health & Fitness in Maryland. “The answer is we still don’t know.”

What we do know is that soreness is an inflammation response to damaged tissues. It generally doesn’t mean you’ve done something wrong, or that you’re getting fitter. In most cases, it’s just an unpleasant side effect of a hard workout, after which your body tends to recover on its own. But if you ignore a sore muscle and jump right back into hard training, you can be at risk for more serious injury.

Finding ways to diminish muscle soreness is a multibillion-dollar industry that features compression recovery boots, massage guns and ice tubs. While many recovery tools do make you feel better, there’s a difference between relief and truly repairing the damaged tissues.

Luckily, you don’t need expensive or elaborate gimmicks to get back on your feet. Simple techniques, along with thinking from the “inside out,” will help you prevent soreness, recover properly and avoid injury.

Use your fascia.
For more than a century, experts thought soreness was caused by lactic acid built up inside muscle cells during exercise, but that line of thinking was largely debunked in the 1980s.

Today, there are two schools of thought on the mechanism of soreness. The theory of exercise-induced muscle damage says that soreness results from tiny tears in your muscular tissue. More recently, however, experts have suggested that soreness might be caused by irritated and inflamed fascia, said Jan Wilke, a professor of sports science at Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt in Austria, who is researching this theory.

As such, he said, it’s helpful to take fascia into consideration during your warm up. A thick, supportive connective tissue, “fascia likes constant movement from multiple directions,” Dr. Wilke said. “So consider a dynamic warm-up that will make the tissue more resilient to the workout ahead.”

Set yourself up for success.
It’s important to be honest with yourself about your fitness level before you exercise, especially if you’re new to it or returning after a break. Too often, people jump into a fitness routine where they left off months or even years ago.

“They’ve got the mentality of a time machine, thinking, ‘Five years ago I could lift 20 pounds, so I can still do that,’” Dr. Shirokobrod said.

Instead, think about the minimum amount of exercise you need to become fitter in the beginning. If it helps, write it down, make a plan — or have a coach make a plan — and stick to it. If you do get sore, resist pushing through it during the next workout. Doing so prevents your muscles from recovering and increases your risk of injury. Also, progress is made when your muscles have time to recover.

Eat and sleep well.
Whether you’re new to fitness, returning after a break or a seasoned, consistent athlete, you’re going to face soreness now and again. Instead of attacking the pain from the outside, with massage guns or ointments, start from the inside. Studies point to both sufficient sleep and good nutrition as factors in injury prevention, including muscle soreness.

At the first sign of soreness, or after a particularly taxing workout, “think about extra calories and protein, or some extra sleep,” Dr. Shirokobrod said. “They support your tissues and help you move forward.”

Force yourself to get moving.
While it’s not good to exercise hard while sore, low-intensity movement is helpful. Lighter duty exercise gets the blood flowing and helps move the recovery process along.

Think easy walks, swimming some gentle laps or even performing a few sets of body-weight squats if your soreness came from weighted squats, for instance.

“If I’m feeling sore and rundown from an intense workout, I’ll dial back and do a short, easy run the next day,” said Jamie Hershfang, 30, an ultrarunner from Chicago who set a record for the fastest time on the Chicago Lakefront Trail in 2020. “This always gets my muscles loosened up and feeling better.”

Easing pain is not fixing muscle.
Resist that urge to take ibuprofen, which some research suggests makes no difference or can even be detrimental. “The research shows that NSAIDs will reduce your feelings of soreness, but they will blunt the actual healing,” said Jason Sawyer, director of the exercise and movement science program at Bryant University.

What about hot tubs, massages, Epsom salt baths or hot/cold contrast baths? They won’t cause any harm, and you might have the perception of feeling better, Dr. Shirokobrod said.

But “understand that’s only sensory relief” and doesn’t affect the strained muscle or fascia itself, he added. You might emerge from these treatments feeling less stiff and sore, he said, but  they cannot penetrate the tissue at a deeper level.

Be aware if it’s more than just soreness.
Some post-workout pain might actually be injury. One indicator is where you feel soreness. If the pain is global — felt in both legs, for instance — you’ve probably only overdone a workout. Injury, on the other hand, tends to be localized. In addition, injuries often cause immediate pain, while you usually don’t feel soreness until after.

If you suspect an injury, dial back on the aggravating activity and see a medical practitioner.

When it comes to beating soreness, simplicity rules the day. “Provide your body with the building blocks it needs to heal,” Dr. Sawyer said, “and it will do the rest.”"
"The Quiet Rage of Caregivers
Looking after a sick family member can mean putting your own life on hold, often with little recognition or outside support.

Ann Brenoff didn’t worry when her dogs returned from a walk without her husband in 2015. He often dropped their leashes and let them race up the steep driveway to their home in the canyons of Los Angeles. “But after 20 or 30 minutes, we said ‘OK, where’s Dad?’” said Ms. Brenoff, 73, whose two children were then teenagers.

They found him lying at the bottom of the driveway. He had collapsed walking up the street and crawled home. Ms. Brenoff’s husband was soon diagnosed with acute kidney failure and needed round-the-clock care.

Three times a week, she made the hourlong drive to his dialysis appointments or arranged for someone else to take him. She cooked separate meals so he could follow a special diet, and squared off daily with their health insurance company. She learned that a bit of Vicks VapoRub under her nose helped mask certain odors as her husband’s condition deteriorated.

“You wake up one day and realize you’re not a partner and a wife anymore,” Ms. Brenoff said. “You’re a full-time medical case manager.” She stopped seeing friends and gained 20 pounds. Her blood pressure climbed.

And she got really angry.

Around 53 million Americans are caregivers for a family member or friend with a health issue or disability, and nearly a third spend 20 or more hours a week in that role. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which calls caregivers the “backbone” of long-term home care in the United States, has warned that caregivers face many risks — anxiety and depression, chronic health conditions and financial strain, to name just a few. Yet experts said many caregivers feel they cannot speak openly about their frustration and anger.

“The stress is just monumental and constant,” Ms. Brenoff said. “I was pissed off.”

“There’s this myth of the loving caregiver,” said Allison Lindauer, an associate professor of neurology with the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine. But she and other experts said that anger and frustration are inevitable parts of the caregiver experience, and that it is important to normalize those feelings.

“There is a lot of stigma,” Dr. Lindauer said.

A loss of control
Allison Applebaum, the director of the Caregivers Clinic at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the author of the forthcoming book “Stand By Me,” said that among the 4,000 or more caregivers she has worked with, she has yet to meet one who has not expressed some form of anger.

Often just beneath that anger is a “deep well of sadness,” Dr. Applebaum said. Many caregivers feel powerless, she said, and take on the role out of necessity or a sense of duty. They have little control over what happens to the person they are caring for, or to themselves.

“Many caregivers can’t plan for the next day or week, let alone the next month or year,” she said. “And that’s maddening.”

That has been a source of frustration for Heidi Warren. For more than eight years, Ms. Warren, 48, has been a full-time caregiver to her mother, whom she lives with in Greenville, Pa. Her mother, 76, had complications from spine surgery in 2015 and developed chronic pneumonia, which has landed her in the hospital more than 30 times.

Recently, her mom has been doing better. But when Ms. Warren was in her early 40s, her mother’s needs were unpredictable. “I essentially had no social life,” she said. She would make plans to see a friend in the evening, only to come home and find her mother in respiratory distress.

“No two days are the same,” Ms. Warren said. “There are times when it’s like, OK, well, I planned to do this today, but now we’re at the E.R.”

The pair are best friends, “so it’s a labor of love,” she added. But many caregivers don’t share that bond.

“Not everybody loves the person they care for,” Dr. Lindauer said.

Making an unrecognized sacrifice
John Poole, 39, became a caregiver in 2014 when both of his parents had strokes within a month of each other. One of his main sources of frustration was the feeling that the health care system did not always take the work he did as a caregiver seriously — even as he took on some of the tasks a skilled nurse might perform, like administering medication and managing tube feedings.

“The first year or so was very chaotic in the sense that I was just learning as I went,” said Mr. Poole, who lives in Sicklerville, N.J., and had to leave his job in state government because of the demands of caregiving.

He did not qualify for state Medicaid programs that would allow him to get paid for his caregiving work. And though he had family help with some of the practical, day-to-day responsibilities, he sometimes felt as if well-intentioned outsiders suggested fixes without understanding the complexities of caregiving in the United States.

“A lot of people’s frustration — I know mine — was that you’re doing very valuable work that is really not recognized by the outside society,” Mr. Poole said.

Finding support through connection
Long-term caregiver stress has been tied to health issues, like diabetes, arthritis and heart disease. Given that, Dr. Applebaum advises caregivers to address the physical effects of anger, whether through breathing exercises, a hot shower or a run — whatever helps. Sometimes, she said, caregivers need a private place where they can just scream.

Every person interviewed for this story mentioned the power of peer support as well.

Jennifer Levin, 42, started a Facebook support group for millennial caregivers seven years ago, after caring for her father. He had progressive supranuclear palsy, a degenerative condition similar to Parkinson’s disease.

“You have the baseline of a common experience, and so you don’t have to explain where you’re coming from with this anger,” Ms. Levin said. “A lot of times, I think people worry if they express it to somebody who doesn’t totally get it, that it will overshadow the totality of their experience.”

Still, she said, there is a limit to how comfortable some people feel sharing, even in a closed forum of peers. “A lot of caregivers are afraid to express their anger, because they feel guilty.”

Ms. Brenoff’s husband of 15 years died in 2017, after 18 months of “misery.” Before he died, she found solace in another Facebook group for caregivers, which observed Throat Punch Thursdays. “That was the one night that you could sign on and say you wanted to scream at somebody,” she said. She has since remarried and written a book about her experience: “Caregivers Are Mad as Hell! Rants From the Wife of the Very Sick Man in Room 5029.”

Though most people have responded positively to her speaking and writing about her anger so openly, it has not always been easy.

“There’s a lot of shame if you dare to say to somebody: ‘No, this actually isn’t rewarding. This isn’t what I signed up for,’” she said."
"A Hairy Truth About Your Sense of Touch
Researchers showed that cells in your hair follicles release important chemical messengers in response to gentle touches to your skin.

When someone brushes a hand across your skin, it’s like a breeze blowing through a forest of countless small hairs. Nerves that surround your hair follicles detect that contact, and very far away in your brain, other cells fire. Some of the neurons responding to light contact might make you shiver and give you goose bumps. Some might tell you to move away. Or they might tell you to move closer.

Scientists who study the sense of touch have explored which cells bear these messages, and they have made an intriguing discovery: Follicle cells triggered by hair movements release the neurotransmitters histamine and serotonin, chemical messengers linked to biological phenomena as varied as inflammation, muscle contraction and mood changes. The observation, reported in October in the journal Science Advances, lays the groundwork for tracing how gentle touch makes us feel the way it does.

Studying hair follicles is challenging, because they begin to decay soon after being removed from the body, said Claire Higgins, a bioengineering professor at Imperial College London and an author of the study. So she and her colleagues went to a hair transplant clinic. There, they were able to look at freshly harvested follicles, which they gently prodded with a very small rod to simulate touch.

The scientists knew from work done by other groups that the neurons in the skin surrounding hair follicles are capable of sensing movement.

“When you brush your hair, you feel it because the sensory neurons are directly being stimulated,” Dr. Higgins said.

But they were curious whether the cells of the follicle itself — the tube from which a hair sprouts — could be contributing to some of the feelings associated with more gentle touch. Not all of the follicle cells had movement sensors, but some did. The researchers identified these and watched them carefully as the rod touched them.

“We found that when we stimulated our hair follicle cells, they actually released mood-regulating neurotransmitters serotonin and histamine,” Dr. Higgins said.

Blocking the receptors for these neurotransmitters on nearby neurons meant that they no longer fired when the hair was stroked, confirming the link between the follicle cells and the neurons’ response.

Just because these neurotransmitters are associated with mood in the brain does not mean that they are linked to emotion elsewhere in the body, Dr. Higgins said. They are messengers, and the nature of the message they carry depends on which cells they are stimulating.

But she points to research by Francis McGlone, a neuroscientist at Liverpool John Moores University in England who has studied the rewarding feelings we get from touch. He and his colleagues have identified nerves in the skin that respond to gentle touch, generating that warm glow we get from human contact.

Were the neurotransmitters being released by follicle cells in this study stimulating those nerves specifically? No one knows, but Dr. Higgins hopes future work will illuminate the identity of the cells the neurotransmitters target. She is curious how increasing levels of serotonin or histamine in the skin might change what happens in the brain, at the other end of the transmission. In the tiny sheath of cells containing each hair, there may be answers to questions about something as fundamental as human connection.

“The follicle never ceases to amaze me,” she said.

"What to Know About Zepbound, the New Weight Loss Drug
The obesity medication contains tirzepatide, the same active ingredient in the diabetes drug Mounjaro.

The decision by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday to approve the weight loss drug tirzepatide adds a potent new tool to the fast-growing arsenal of obesity drugs.

The drug, which will go by the brand name Zepbound, contains the same compound in the sought-after diabetes drug Mounjaro. Many people have used Mounjaro off-label to lose weight since it was initially approved in May 2022, but the move could pave the way for insurance coverage and open the floodgates for more prescriptions.

Zepbound is the second drug in a new class of obesity medications to be approved for weight loss, following Wegovy. And it is now likely the most effective treatment to combat obesity besides bariatric surgery, said Dr. Scott Hagan, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Washington. But for many, Mounjaro has been hard to find in the year since it hit the market.

“It’s very similar to what we went through with Ozempic,” said Dr. Andrew Kraftson, a clinical associate professor in the division of metabolism, endocrinology and diabetes at Michigan Medicine, noting that demand for weight loss medications has hit a “fever pitch.” Now, he said, patients will likely be clamoring for this new drug. Here’s what to know.

Who qualifies for Zepbound?
The F.D.A. approved Zepbound for people who have a body mass index — a much-criticized metric — of 30 or greater, which technically qualifies them as having obesity, or those with a B.M.I. of 27 who also have certain weight-related conditions, such as high blood pressure. Regulators said the drug should be used in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity.

A Close Look at Weight Loss Drugs
Teenage Obesity: Twenty-two percent of adolescents age 12 to 19 have obesity. But pediatricians are hesitant to prescribe medicines like Wegovy, citing their newness and uncertainties around them.
Menopausal Weight Gain: Some women going through menopause are seeking drugs like Ozempic to help with excess weight. Experts worry about the risks, but some doctors are beginning to oblige.
A Striking Benefit: A pivotal new study suggests that the weight loss drug Wegovy cut the risk of heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular issues by 20% among overweight or obese people with heart disease.
Reshaping Denmark’s Economy: Novo Nordisk, the Danish company behind Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug also used by some people for weight loss, is reaping huge profits and is now responsible for most of the country’s economic growth.
Side Effects: Diabetes treatments that are used to lose weight can reduce people’s desire to drink alcohol and their obsessive thinking about food. The drugs also carry serious risks, including malnutrition and facial aging.
How does tirzepatide work for weight loss?
Zepbound, made by Eli Lilly, is the brand name for tirzepatide when used for weight loss. When the drug is prescribed for diabetes, it is sold under the brand name Mounjaro.

Like semaglutide, the compound in Ozempic and Wegovy, tirzepatide slows down the emptying of the stomach. People feel fuller, quicker and for longer. All three drugs also target the area of the brain that regulates appetite, blunting cravings for many people.

Semaglutide simulates a single hormone in the body, while tirzepatide mimics two, which experts say may be why it’s often more effective at triggering weight loss. In a 72-week clinical trial, funded by Eli Lilly,  participants with obesity taking the highest dose of tirzepatide lost around 18 percent of their body weight on average.

If I’m already taking Ozempic or Wegovy, should I switch?
Not everyone reacts to these medications in the same way — someone might lose little to no weight on semaglutide, but shed pounds on tirzepatide, and vice versa, said Dr. Janice Jin Hwang, the division chief of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. People whose weight loss may be most closely tied to other health outcomes — such as those at risk for heart failure or liver disease — may benefit more from losing a significant amount of weight on a drug like Zepbound.

But some people can lose too much weight taking these drugs, Dr. Hwang cautioned. Older people, in particular, should be mindful about their weight loss, since it can lead to shrinking muscle mass. Physicians need to weigh the risks and benefits for each patient, she said.

“There’s no guidelines around any of this,” she said. “We’re just trying to think holistically about the patient.”

Will insurance cover it and what is it likely to cost out of pocket?
Coverage can differ from plan to plan, but some insurance companies will likely cover it for those who meet the F.D.A.’s criteria. Eli Lilly said in a press release that it expects Zepbound will be available in the U.S. by the end of the year at a list price of $1,059.87.

What are the side effects?
In an Eli Lilly-funded study of tirzepatide for obesity, gastrointestinal issues were the most common side effects. Roughly one-third of participants taking the highest dose of tirzepatide experienced nauseaand around one-fifth experienced diarrhea. Some participants also reported abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, headache and dizziness. The F.D.A. approval states that people taking Zepbound may also experience burping, hair loss and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Because tirzepatide is so new, we do not know much yet about its long-term effects, Dr. Hwang said. And people taking these kinds of drugs for weight loss typically are advised to stay on them for the rest of their lives, she said."
"F.D.A. Approves New Obesity Drug That Will Compete With Wegovy
Zepbound, which is already sold by Eli Lilly as the diabetes treatment Mounjaro, was shown to reduce patients’ weight by as much as one-fifth in drug trials.

The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved an obesity drug from the company Eli Lilly that will be a direct competitor to the wildly popular Wegovy.

The drug is called tirzepatide and will be sold under the name Zepbound. It joins a class of new medications that are transforming obesity, a condition that affects 100 million American adults and is linked to a spectrum of diseases including diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, liver disease, kidney disease and joint pain.

Patients who used tirzepatide lost an average of 18 percent of their body weight, according to the F.D.A., when it was taken at its highest dose in a drug trial. That’s compared with Wegovy, manufactured by Novo Nordisk, which produced an average 15 percent weight loss.

The F.D.A. approved Zepbound for people with obesity and for those who are overweight and have at least one obesity-related condition.

Tirzepatide is already approved for diabetes under the brand name Mounjaro where it competes with Novo Nordisk’s diabetes drug semaglutide, known better as Ozempic. But until now, Wegovy — also semaglutide but with a higher maximum dose than Ozempic — was the only approved drug that could safely elicit substantial weight loss in people with obesity alone.

Side effects with Zepbound, similar to those with Wegovy, Ozempic and Mounjaro, are mostly gastrointestinal, like nausea and diarrhea. Most patients tolerated or overcame them.

In a news release, Dr. John Sharretts, director of the Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders and Obesity in the F.D.A.’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said, “In light of increasing rates of both obesity and overweight in the United States, today’s approval addresses an unmet medical need.”

Susan Yanovski, co-director of the office of obesity research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, said, “Just a few years ago it would be difficult to imagine two medications like semaglutide and tirzepatide that lead to weight loss that previously was only seen when people had bariatric surgery,” referring to a surgical treatment that is a proven effective treatment for obesity.

The approval comes at a time when Novo Nordisk is unable to produce enough Wegovy to satisfy the huge demand for the drug. Tirzepatide, which patients take by a self-administered injection once a week, as they do with Wegovy, could ease those shortages.

Competition could also result in lower net prices for both drugs, or how much payers actually spend on them. The prices are high for Wegovy — with a list price up to $1,349 every four weeks in one recent analysis, and a net price around $700. Zepbound is starting with a list price of around $1,060, according to Eli Lilly.

“You’d want the price competition to come sooner rather than later,” said Craig Garthwaite, a health care economist at Northwestern University. Once people start taking one of these drugs, he said, “they get locked in.” They resist switching even if a competing drug costs less.

Development of Zepbound began in 2017 with a small study involving 300 people with type 2 diabetes. After 3 months, many lost at least 13 percent of their body weight. Eli Lilly presented the data at a diabetes meeting in Germany. Some in the audience gasped.

Then came a large 72-week study sponsored by Eli Lilly of tirzepatide in 2,539 people with obesity.

In a packed room at a meeting of the American Diabetes Association last year, the study’s principal investigator, Dr. Ania Jastreboff of Yale, revealed the results. More than half the patients receiving the highest dose lost at least 20 percent of their body weight.No drug has ever before shown such a profound weight loss.

For Eli Lilly, the results were a culmination of research that began a decade ago. But like Novo Nordisk, the company was trying to produce a new diabetes drug.

“Obesity wasn’t a main focus for us,” Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, the chief scientific and medical officer at Eli Lilly, said, adding that “it was not seen as a commercial opportunity.”

The sad history of weight loss drugs was a lesson, he thought. “There had never been a successful obesity drug,” he said, “and previous drugs didn’t cause enough weight loss to have an impact on peoples’ health.”

But researchers at Eli Lilly had started investigating a diabetes drug that combined two molecules. One molecule acts like a hormone, GLP-1, that prompts the body to secrete insulin when blood sugar rises. That was similar to the effects of Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy. And like those drugs, it also suppresses appetite.

But more than one hormone is involved when the body regulates blood sugar, so the company’s scientists decided to try combining the molecule that mimics GLP-1 with a second molecule that acts like the gut hormone GIP. Although GIP has a more modest effect when given alone, it amplified GLP-1’s effect when the two hormone mimics were combined.

In mice, the two-drug combination not only lowered blood sugar but also had a profound effect on weight. It was “the most weight loss we’d ever seen,” Dr. Skovronsky said.

The company’s scientists tested the drug in healthy volunteers. Even though they did not have obesity, the people lost weight.

Suddenly, Eli Lilly’s opinion of studying weight loss changed.

“We thought, ‘This medicine can change the world,’” Dr. Skovronsky said. “We said: ‘This is the one. This is our priority.’”

They decided to speed development with an approach known as “investing at risk” in which they do not wait for each stage of testing to be completed before starting the next, and in which they start building manufacturing capability before studies are completed. The result was a pace that was a record for the company — six years from the first dose in human volunteers to F.D.A. approval. A similar strategy was also used to speed up Covid vaccine development.

The hope is that Zepbound can reduce the chances that people with obesity will develop the potentially deadly complications that accompany the condition.

But Zepbound is only the beginning for Eli Lilly. The company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are working on drugs that could be even more powerful.

The next Lilly drug adds glucagon, another gut hormone, to the two in Zepbound. It apparently stimulates metabolism and draws fat out of the liver.

And, like Novo Nordisk and other companies, Eli Lilly is working on a pill form of tirzepatide. It is undergoing clinical testing.

Making injectable drugs is complicated and challenging. Pills are simpler and cheaper, which could improve the supply problem that has affected patients who use Ozempic and Wegovy.

It is estimated that by 2030, a billion people in the world will have obesity.

“All the companies in the world cannot make that many injections,” Dr. Skovronsky said. “Clearly if we are going to meet the needs of the global epidemic, we need oral drugs.”"
"Senate Confirms Biden’s Pick for N.I.H. Director Over Sanders’s Objections
Dr. Monica M. Bertagnolli won bipartisan approval despite opposition from Senator Bernie Sanders, the chairman of the Senate health committee.

The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Dr. Monica M. Bertagnolli, a cancer surgeon who currently leads the National Cancer Institute, as the next director of the National Institutes of Health, overriding the objections of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate health committee.

The vote was 62 to 36, with Mr. Sanders voting no. In a statement last month, he said that while Dr. Bertagnolli was an “intelligent and caring person,” he would vote against her because she “has not convinced me that she is prepared to take on the greed and power of the drug companies and health care industry.”

Dr. Bertagnolli will become only the second woman to lead the N.I.H. on a permanent basis, after Dr. Bernadine P. Healy, who served under President George H.W. Bush. She will take over an agency that has been the target of political attacks by Republicans, who have accused its scientists of intentionally downplaying the possibility that Covid-19 was the result of a laboratory leak.

“I think no one wants to know what the true origin of the last Covid pandemic was more than the biomedical research community,” Dr. Bertagnolli told Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the top Republican on the health committee, during her confirmation hearing last month.

“And how will you accomplish that?” asked Mr. Cassidy, who is a medical doctor. Dr. Bertagnolli promised she would make any data on the subject “available, public and accountable to the American people.”

President Biden announced in May that he would nominate Dr. Bertagnolli to lead the N.I.H., the world’s premier medical research agency, which has an annual budget of more than $47 billion and occupies a sprawling campus in Bethesda, Md. It has been without a permanent director since Dr. Francis S. Collins stepped down nearly two years ago.

But in an unusual twist, Mr. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, held up Dr. Bertagnolli’s confirmation hearing for months in an effort to prod Mr. Biden to take more aggressive action to lower drug prices.

The stalemate finally ended in September, after the Department of Health and Human Services announced a $326 million contract with Regeneron to develop a new monoclonal antibody treatment for Covid-19. The deal stipulated that if the drug comes to market, its list price must be equal to or lower than the price in other major countries — a provision that prompted Mr. Sanders to announce he would schedule a hearing for Dr. Bertagnolli.

The hearing went well for Dr. Bertagnolli, who grew up on a ranch in southwestern Wyoming and was introduced to the committee by a Republican from that state, Senator John Barrasso. He lauded her as someone who understands rural America and said he had been chatting up her neighbors.

“They speak of her grit, her endurance and her determination,” Mr. Barrasso, who is a medical doctor, said, adding, “Her commitment to the land and the livestock speaks volumes about her character and her courage.”

Dr. Bertagnolli is also a cancer patient. She announced late last year that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She told the committee that she had completed her treatment and that her prognosis “is excellent.”

“I also had access to outstanding care, knowing full well that not every patient has that same chance,” she said. “Most importantly, every treatment I received was supported by N.I.H.-funded research.”"
"Infants Are Born With Syphilis in Growing Numbers, a Sign of a Wider Epidemic
Congenital syphilis has become more than ten times as common over the past decade, the C.D.C. reported. “The situation is dire,” said one expert.

The rise in sexually transmitted infections in the United States has taken a particularly tragic turn: More than 3,700 cases of congenital syphilis were reported in 2022, roughly 11 times the number recorded a decade ago, according to data released on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Syphilis during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage and stillbirth, and infants who survive may become blind or deaf, or have severe developmental delays. In 2022, the disease caused 231 stillbirths and 51 infant deaths.

Nearly 90 percent of the new cases could have been prevented with timely testing and treatment, according to the agency.

“Syphilis in babies continues to increase, and the situation is dire,” Dr. Laura Bachmann, chief medical officer at the agency’s division for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, said in an interview. “We need to do things differently.”

“One case is an indication of a breakdown in the public health infrastructure, and now we have 3,700 cases,” she added.

The system breaks down in multiple ways. Nearly 38 percent of the 3,700 babies were born to women who received no prenatal care. Of the women who had at least one prenatal appointment, 30 percent were never tested for syphilis or were tested too late.

And among those who tested positive for syphilis, 88 percent received inadequate, undocumented or no treatment.

Public health departments used to have teams of disease-intervention specialists and nurses who made sure that pregnant women were tested and treated — even if that meant giving them shots in their homes — and traced all of their contacts, said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of the University of Mississippi’s John D. Bower School of Population Health.

But those departments have been gutted over the years.

“You can’t dismantle the infrastructure of public health and not expect for bad things to happen,” Dr. Dobbs said. “I can’t believe that we’re at this state of health in a country as wealthy as we are.”

Calling the rise in congenital syphilis “a shameful crisis” accelerated by funding cutbacks and bureaucratic obstacles, the National Coalition of STD Directors on Tuesday demanded $1 billion in federal funding and a White House syphilis response coordinator to stem the tide.

Syphilis was nearly eliminated in the United States about 20 years ago, but rose by 74 percent, to 177,000 cases, between 2017 and 2021. Other S.T.I.s are also on the rise: In 2021, there were 1.6 million cases of chlamydia and more than 700,000 cases of gonorrhea.

The numbers were rising even before the pandemic, but in the past few years, a drop in routine preventive care, a shift to more telehealth appointments for prenatal care, and reduced clinic hours may have exacerbated the situation.

The reasons for the increase in congenital syphilis varied a bit by region. No testing, or testing too late, accounted for 56 percent of cases in the West, and inadequate treatment caused 55 percent of cases in the South.

In Mississippi, people may have to drive for hours to find an obstetrician, or they may not have the transportation, job or family situation to facilitate seeking health care.

“If you’re in a really poverty-endemic state like Mississippi is, where working-class folks are really just struggling to get by, everything is a barrier,” Dr. Dobbs said.

Nationwide, about one in five pregnant women who were diagnosed with syphilis did not receive any prenatal care, suggesting that they were tested in another setting, such as an emergency room, prison or needle-exchange program.

That proportion was higher in Michigan, where about a third of all S.T.I.s were diagnosed in emergency departments. “More and more people are receiving what should be routine preventive health care in emergency departments,” said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state’s chief medical executive.

Because E.R. doctors do not have longstanding relationships with the patients, “it’s easier for folks to fall through the cracks,” she said.

Syphilis was resurging primarily among men who have sex with men, but in recent years it has crept into heterosexual networks. Among women of reproductive age, syphilis diagnoses rose by 17.2 percent between 2021 and 2022, according to the new report.

But public health departments are not as well connected to heterosexual women as they are to community organizations that help gay and bisexual men with H.I.V. and S.T.I. prevention.

“There’s a lack of awareness among women of childbearing age that syphilis is still around and that it can impact them and what the consequences could look like for their unborn child,” Dr. Bagdasarian said.

Pregnant women may not have symptoms nor realize they need to be tested or treated.

The C.D.C. recommends screening for syphilis at the first prenatal visit or as soon as pregnancy is identified. For women at high risk of infection because of where they live, substance use or sexual behavior, the C.D.C. suggests screening twice more: at 28 weeks of gestation and at delivery.

Many states go further, mandating that all pregnant women be tested for the infection at all three time points. That’s in part because women who test negative early in pregnancy may acquire syphilis later on.

They may even be “at greater risk because they are no longer using protection such as condoms,” said Dr. Melanie Taylor, medical epidemiologist for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health in Arizona.

Prevention efforts must extend beyond prenatal care for pregnant women and reach their partners, as well as other heterosexual men and women, Dr. Taylor said.

Maricopa County has some of the highest congenital syphilis rates in the nation. Nearly half of the women in the county who had babies with syphilis received no prenatal care in 2022. Drug use, particularly of fentanyl and methamphetamine, and recent incarceration are big contributors, Dr. Taylor said.

The county is working with hospitals and community organizations to reach women who are using drugs, were recently incarcerated, have unstable housing or are otherwise at high risk for syphilis.

The public S.T.I. clinic, which serves up to 35,000 patients a year, charges a flat fee of $20 to test and treat patients and their partners, and waives the fee if cost is an obstacle.

Confirming a syphilis diagnosis usually takes two positive tests, but the C.D.C. is recommending that providers treat women who may not return after a single positive result.

Early cases of syphilis in a pregnant woman can be treated with a single shot of an antibiotic called benzathine penicillin G, marketed as Bicillin by Pfizer. In June, Pfizer warned the Food and Drug Administration that Bicillin was in short supply, in part because of the sharp rise in demand for syphilis treatment.

The C.D.C. has asked health care providers to prioritize Bicillin’s use for pregnant women with syphilis. The only alternative is doxycycline, which must be taken twice a day over several weeks and is not recommended for pregnant women.

The new study was conducted before the drug’s shortage, so the treatment figures for this year may be worse.

More options for treatment, particularly ones that are affordable, would ease matters, as would vaccines and better tests. “The syphilis testing technology has really not changed much in many, many, many decades,” Dr. Bachmann said.

“There’s a lot of room for work here,” she said. “It’s obvious we have a broken system.”"
"When a Child Is Shot, Trauma Ripples Through Families, Study Finds
Gunshots are the top cause of death for children and teenagers in the U.S. Fatal or not, the wounds reverberate through communities and the health care system.

With each mass shooting, Americans look to one grim indicator — the number of dead — as a measure of the destructive impact. But damage left behind by gunshot wounds reverberates among survivors and families, sending mental health disorders soaring and shifting huge burdens onto the health care system, a new analysis of private health insurance claims shows.

In 2020, gunshot wounds became the leading cause of death for children and adolescents in the United States. Though the government does not systematically track nonfatal gunshot wounds, existing evidence suggests that they are two to three times as common as fatal ones. These wounds can be especially catastrophic in children, whose bodies are so small that the amount of tissue destroyed is greater.

“What comes after the gunshot is so often not talked about,” said Dr. Chana Sacks, co-director of the Gun Violence Prevention Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and an author of the new study, published on Monday in the journal Health Affairs. The study, which analyzed thousands of insurance claims, maps out lasting damage to families and communities.

For families in which a child died of a gunshot wound, surviving family members experienced a sharp increase in psychiatric disorders, taking more psychiatric medications and making more visits to mental health professionals: Fathers had a 5.3-fold increase in treatment for psychiatric disorders in the year after the death; mothers had a 3.6-fold increase; and surviving siblings had a 2.3-fold increase.

Children and teenagers who survive gunshot wounds become, as Dr. Sacks put it, “more like lifelong patients.” During the year after the injury, their medical costs rose by an average of $34,884, a 17-fold increase from baseline, driven by hospitalizations, emergency room visits and home health care, the study found.

Children and adolescents who survived the most severe gunshot wounds, requiring treatment in an intensive care unit, struggled considerably. In that group, diagnoses of pain disorders increased 293 percent, and psychiatric disorders increased by 321 percent.

The study examined medical records from 2,052 children who survived gunshots, 6,209 family members of children who survived, and 265 family members of children who died from gunshot wounds, comparing each with five controls. Because the study was based on private insurance claims, it did not reflect the experience of families who were uninsured or on public insurance.

Rising costs linked to firearms injuries make it “increasingly an economic issue,” said Dr. Zirui Song, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the study. The prevalence of gunshot wounds has quadrupled over the last 12 years in the population covered by private insurance, he said.

In a paper published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Song calculated the annual cost of firearms injuries in lost wages and medical spending as $557 billion, or 2.6 percent of gross domestic product. The new study is the first to focus on the cost of nonfatal gunshot wounds, he said.

“The cruel reality is that if one dies from a firearm injury, one is free to society — there’s no more health care spending, no more taxpayer dollars, no more resources used,” he said. “But actually surviving a firearm injury is quite expensive to society. The magnitude of that was previously not known.”

National data on nonfatal gunshot wounds is “disturbingly unreliable,” but many survivors face long-term disability, said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency room physician and the dean of the Yale School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study.

“It may be that they have been shot in the intestine, or through a major blood vessel, it could be a bullet has gone through their lung,” Dr. Ranney said. “It can also be that they’ve been shot through the head or the spine.”

Trauma physicians have long observed the ripple effect of shootings on the health of family members and communities, she said, often because of repeated visits to the emergency room for nightmares, anxiety or depression, but “we’ve never been able to measure it.”

Clementina Chery, a Boston woman whose 15-year-old son was fatally shot in crossfire in 1993, and who founded the Louis D. Brown Peace Institute, an organization to support families who have lost members to gun violence, said she had often seen survivors struggle with addictive behavior, job loss, suicidal or homicidal thoughts in the years after a young person dies.

“In that immediate aftermath, I just felt that I was having an out-of-body experience,” Ms. Chery said. She turned to alcohol, she said — “a little wine here, a little wine there” — and found it difficult to leave her house. Her marriage ended. What finally woke her up, she said, was realizing that her younger children were starved of attention.

“I literally was going through the motions,” she said. “I was not living. It was like, what do you call it, a mechanical robot.”

The ripple effect of gunshot wounds is important because these injuries tend to be concentrated in specific communities, usually communities of color, where many young people know someone who has been shot, Dr. Sacks said.

She traced her interest in the subject to the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where the 7-year-old son of her cousin was one of 20 children killed. The child’s death “changed my life” and has continued to shape extended families and communities in the years that followed, she said.

“We can’t think about this as a problem that starts and ends with the bullet going in and then the acute surgical care,” Dr. Sacks said. “Leaving the hospital is just the beginning of that family’s journey, and I think we need to treat it that way.”

"Male-Killing Virus Is Discovered in Insects
The chance finding in a Japanese university’s greenhouse could help researchers find ways to control agricultural pests or even insects that spread disease.

Scientists in Japan have identified a virus that selectively kills males — and it happens to be inheritable, creating generation upon generation of all females.

The discovery, made in caterpillars and described Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, is “robust” evidence that “more than one virus has evolved to selectively kill male insects,” said Greg Hurst, a symbiont specialist at the University of Liverpool in England who wasn’t involved in the study. That could one day help control populations of pest insects and disease vectors like mosquitoes.

“I expect there are a lot more cases like this that will be discovered in the near future,” said Daisuke Kageyama, a researcher at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization in Japan and one of the study’s authors.

The virus was found by chance. Misato Terao, a research technician at Minami Kyushu University, was straightening up the campus greenhouse when she found unwelcome intruders — fat green caterpillars — nibbling on the impatiens. She scooped them up and, on a whim, dropped them off in the lab of Yoshinori Shintani, an insect physiologist who is Minami Kyushu’s resident bug guy.

Dr. Shintani decided the caterpillars — tobacco cutworms, a ravenous pest species and scourge of Asian agriculture — might be useful to feed to other insects. “It was almost a miracle” they didn’t end up in the trash, he said. By the time he remembered them several days later, he had about 50 adult moths, and unexpectedly, all of them were female.

On a hunch, he bred the females from the greenhouse with male tobacco moths he found fluttering around the lights in his own home. The greenhouse moths only had daughters — and so did their daughters, and their daughters’ daughters. Over 13 generations of the moths’ descendants, only three had males.

Dr. Shintani and his colleague Dr. Kageyama quickly realized they had a “male-killer” on their hands.

For decades, scientists have known that microbial hitchhikers, usually bacteria, can take up residence in the jellylike cytoplasm of insects’ cells. And through a process that’s not very well understood, those microbes can be passed from mother to offspring.

Sometimes these microbial symbionts tamper with the host’s reproduction. From the symbiont’s perspective, “males are useless” because they can’t help propagate the microbe, Dr. Kageyama said. So the symbiont simply eliminates them. The bacteria Wolbachia can prevent male butterflies from being born. Other bacteria kill developing males before they hatch, reducing competition for the females and giving them a fortifying snack: the eggs that held their brothers.

Dr. Shintani’s team found that antibiotics didn’t knock out the male-killing effect in the greenhouse moth’s progeny, so bacteria couldn’t be responsible. Genetic analysis turned up telltale signs of a virus, but unlike any male-killer ever seen before. Only two male-killing viruses have ever been documented; the virus found by the Japanese researchers, which they named SlMKV, seems to have evolved separately.

To confirm the male-killer was actually infectious and inheritable, Dr. Shintani needed to juice some tobacco moths. He and his team blended the bodies of pupae and adult moths with SlMKV and injected the resulting slurry into the bodies of uninfected pupae and moths. That did the trick — the next generation heavily favored females, and in subsequent generations males vanished altogether.

Further experiments revealed just how lucky the researchers were to find this male-killer. While cool weather can be lethal to tobacco cutworms, SlMKV is vulnerable to heat, and the researchers found that the virus’s effect was diminished and eventually neutralized at higher temperatures. The tobacco cutworm’s native range is in subtropical parts of China and Taiwan.

The scientists suspect the balmy climate in the caterpillar’s home acts like a perpetual fever, suppressing the male-killing effect. It was pure chance that Japan’s mild temperatures fell in the “Goldilocks zone” in which SlMKV is active, and that scientists could therefore notice the sex imbalance in the greenhouse.

Outside experts say the team’s discovery is a sign that viral male-killers are more common than anticipated. And the find could have implications for controlling other important agricultural pests to which the tobacco cutworm is closely related, Dr. Hurst said.

Anything researchers can learn about male-killers helps advance the quest for the pest controller’s holy grail: a “female-killer,” which could help fight invasive pests or disease-carrying species such as mosquitoes.

According to Anne Duplouy, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Helsinki who studies microbial symbionts in insects, time is running out for humans to learn from these temperature-sensitive microbes. As the climate changes, she said, “we are likely to be losing many of these interactions” before they can be documented."
"Ending TB Is Within Reach — So Why Are Millions Still Dying?
Tuberculosis has passed Covid as the top infectious disease killer, despite new medicines and better diagnostic tools.

At Kaneshie Polyclinic, a health center in a hardscrabble neighborhood of Accra, the capital of Ghana, there is a rule. Every patient who walks through the door — a woman in labor, a construction worker with an injury, a child with malaria — is screened for tuberculosis.

This policy, a national one, is meant to address a tragic problem; two-thirds of the people in this country with tuberculosis don’t know they have it.

Tuberculosis, which is preventable and curable, has reclaimed the title of the world’s leading infectious disease killer, after being supplanted from its long reign by Covid-19. But worldwide, 40 percent of people who are living with TB are untreated and undiagnosed, according to the World Health Organization. The disease killed 1.36 million people in 2022, according to a new W.H.O. report released on Tuesday.

The numbers are all the more troubling because this is a moment of great hope in the fight against TB: Significant innovations in diagnosing and treating it have started to reach developing countries, and clinical trial results show promise for a new vaccine. Infectious disease experts who have battled TB for decades express a new conviction that, with enough money and a commitment to bring those tools to neglected communities, TB could be nearly vanquished.

“This is the best news we’ve seen in tuberculosis in decades,” said Puneet Dewan, an epidemiologist with the TB program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “But there’s a gap between having an exciting pipeline and actually reaching people with those tools.”

A recent visit to the Kaneshie clinic revealed both the progress and the remaining barriers. Despite the clinic’s policy of screening everyone for TB, which most often attacks the lungs, by asking a few questions about coughs and other symptoms, patients streamed into the single-story, cement-block building and were sent for care without any such queries. A member of the TB team, it turned out, was on holiday, another was on maternity leave and a third was out sick. That left just two, who were busy processing tests and doling out drugs.

So no one was screened, not that day or any other day in the previous week.

“It is a good policy, it works well when we can do it, but personnel is a problem,” said Haphsheitu Yahaya, the tuberculosis coordinator at the clinic.

When the screening policy is working, new medications — the first to come to market since the 1970s — can be taken as just a couple of pills each day, rather than as handfuls of tablets and painful injections, the way TB treatments have been delivered in the past.

Those diagnosed with drug-resistant TB receive medication to take for six months — a far shorter time than previously required. For decades, the standard treatment for drug-resistant TB was to take drugs daily for a year and a half, sometimes two years. Inevitably, many patients stopped taking the medicines before they were cured and ended up with more severe disease. The new drugs have far fewer onerous side effects than older medications, which could cause permanent deafness and psychiatric disorders. Such improvements help more people to continue taking the drugs, which is good for patients, and eases the strain on a fragile health system.

In Ghana and most other countries with a high prevalence of TB, the drugs are paid for by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, an international partnership that raises money to help countries fight the diseases.  The sustainability of those programs depends on donor largess. Currently, the treatment for adults recommended by the W.H.O. costs at least $150 per patient in low- and middle-income countries.

“If our patients had to pay, we would not have one single person taking treatment,” Ms. Yahaya said.

Still, there has been progress in recent months in making the medicines more affordable, and prices may soon drop further. Johnson & Johnson has lowered the price of a key TB drug in some developing countries. The company had faced pressure from patient advocacy groups, the United Nations and even the novelist John Green, who devoted his widely followed TikTok account to TB test and treatment prices. The company also agreed in September not to enforce a patent, which means generic drug companies in India and elsewhere will be able to make a significantly cheaper version of the medication.

And for the first time in more than a hundred years, there is real hope for an effective vaccine: A promising candidate called M72, developed by the pharmaceutical company GSK with financial backing from the Gates Foundation and other philanthropies, is now in the last stage of clinical trials.

(However, as ProPublica recently reported, it’s not clear who will have the rights to sell the vaccine, where it will be available and how much it will cost. Taxpayer and philanthropic money has paid for much of the vaccine’s development, but GSK retains control of critical components.)

M72 is one of 17 vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in trials, providing a wellspring of possibilities. The only TB vaccine in use today was first given to people in 1921; it is helpful primarily for babies and does little to protect adolescents and adults, who account for more than 90 percent of TB transmission globally.

Better technology to diagnose TB is slowly reaching clinics in developing countries. Clinics across South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, including the one in Ghana, now have machinery to use rapid molecular diagnostic tests — equipment that was donated as part of the Covid response. That means that many health centers have finally stopped using an unreliable diagnostic method, developed in the 1800s, of viewing sputum smears under microscopes.

Still, last year, less than half of people diagnosed with TB were first given a molecular test, according to the new TB report. The rest were diagnosed with a microscope, or, in many cases, by their clinical symptoms.

The molecular diagnosis can also spot drug-resistant TB right away. (The old method involved starting a person on a course of the most common drugs and waiting to see whether the treatment worked; if patients had the drug-resistant form of the disease, they just got sicker.)

Joshua Dodoo, a driver, came to Kaneshie clinic in March with a lingering cough. He had been shedding pounds and couldn’t sleep. When he saw a doctor for what he thought was malaria, he was sent for a TB test. The one PCR machine in the clinic’s lab was in heavy use, so it was a few days before he learned from a nurse that he had TB.

“I was so frightened,” Mr. Dodoo said, adding that he had not realized people still caught the disease.

His wife, Sadia Ribiro, was calmer and able to hear the nurse, Richard Boadi, explain that there is a cure, and that Mr. Dodoo would be given the treatment for free.

Ms. Ribiro was tested; people living in close contact with a person who has TB account for a significant percentage of the 10.6 million new infections each year. She was negative, and was put on a course of preventive drugs for three months. These medications are new, too: Until recently, preventive therapy could take a year or more, and few patients finished it.

But then, the system broke down. The couple’s two children, who are 3 and 11, were not screened. Mr. Dodoo said they were in school so it was difficult to bring them to the clinic, and they had seemed healthy. Then, even as he started regaining weight and feeling better, the children started coughing and complaining of fatigue.

But they didn’t get a test until months later, when Mr. Boadi tracked them down at home. Only 30 percent of TB infections in children are diagnosed.

Ms. Yahaya, the clinic director, said that, while preventive therapy worked remarkably well, the experience of Mr. Dodoo’s family was typical. People who are newly diagnosed don’t want anyone to know that they have the disease, which is associated with poverty and suffering, so they don’t volunteer information about other people who may have been infected. And the understaffed health system struggles to track them.

Only 169 health centers across Ghana have the capacity to use the new testing method. Usually, samples must be sent away — up to a three-hour drive in some rural areas. By the time results come in, it can be hard to track down those who were tested.

“The equation is simple: If we were putting more resources into testing for TB, we would be finding more TB,” said Dr. Yaw Adusi-Poku, who heads Ghana’s national TB control program.

That will require more molecular testing sites, more staff members trained to spot the disease, more people to ask questions at the clinic door, more nurses like the intrepid Mr. Boadi, who turns up at his patients’ doors to encourage them to have their families tested (and who frequently digs into his own pocket to help patients pay for bus fare to pick up their drugs).

Molecular diagnosis is considerably more expensive than the old method. Cepheid, the company that makes cartridges for the testing machines, recently agreed to cut the price of each one to $8 from $10, which the company says is at cost. An analysis commissioned by Doctors Without Borders found that the cartridges could be made for under $5; the company says this is inaccurate. Cepheid continues to charge $15 per test for the diagnosis of extremely drug-resistant TB, the most lethal form of the disease.

Funding for TB services in low- and middle-income countries fell to $5.8 billion in 2022 from $6.4 billion in 2018, which is just half of what the W.H.O. says is needed. About $1 billion is available each year for TB research, half the amount that the United Nations says is required.

At a special meeting on TB at the United Nations in September, governments committed to spending at least $22 billion a year on TB by 2027. But at a similar meeting in 2018, the same donors promised to spend $13 billion by 2022, less than half of which materialized.

“I’m happy that we have these innovations, but the fact that they exist, that the W.H.O. recommends them, doesn’t mean people have access to them,” said Dr. Madhukar Pai, the associate director of the McGill International TB Centre at McGill University in Montreal. “The costs are still too high, and you need someone to deliver them.”"
"Tyson Recalls Nearly 30,000 Pounds of Chicken Nuggets Over Metal Pieces
Tyson said it had received complaints from consumers about finding small metal pieces in the product. Federal regulators said one “minor oral injury” had been reported.

Tyson Foods is recalling nearly 30,000 pounds of its dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets after some consumers said they found small metal pieces in them, federal officials said.

The recall, which was announced on Saturday, involves 29-ounce plastic bags of the product, which is called “Fully Cooked Fun Nuggets Breaded Shaped Chicken Patties,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement.

The recall affects approximately 29,819 pounds of the dinosaur-shaped nuggets, which were produced on Sept. 5 by the Arkansas-based food processing company.

The bags affected have a “best if used by” date of Sept. 4, 2024, and lot codes 2483BRV0207, 2483BRV0208, 2483BRV0209 and 2483BRV0210, the statement said. The packaging features cartoon dinosaurs, one green and one red, looking over a plate of the breaded nuggets.

On its website, the company said it was voluntarily recalling the product “out of an abundance of caution.” It added that no other products were affected.

The products were shipped to distributors in Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service statement.

Tyson said the problem was discovered after it received complaints from consumers who said they found small metal pieces in the product, the federal agency said.

There was one report of a “minor oral injury” associated with the consumption of the product but no additional reports of injury or illness, officials said.

“Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a health care provider,” the federal statement said.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service urged consumers not to eat the nuggets and advised that any product left in the freezer “should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.”

This is not the first recall involving Tyson chicken products. In 2019, the company recalled 69,093 pounds of frozen chicken strips after two people reported finding pieces of metal in the product, the Department of Agriculture said at the time."
"William Pelham Jr., Who Rethought How A.D.H.D. Is Treated, Dies at 75
A child psychologist, he argued that behavioral therapy had to come first in addressing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, with drugs like Ritalin as a supplement.

William E. Pelham Jr., a child psychologist who challenged how his field approached attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, arguing for a therapy-based regimen that used drugs like Ritalin and Adderall as an optional supplement, died on Oct. 21 in Miami. He was 75.

His son, William E. Pelham III, who is also a child psychologist, confirmed the death, in a hospital, but did not provide a cause.

Dr. Pelham began his career in the mid-1970s, when the modern understanding of mental health was emerging and psychologists were only beginning to understand A.D.H.D. — and with it a new generation of medication to treat it.

Through the 1980s and ’90s, doctors and many parents embraced A.D.H.D. drugs like Ritalin and Adderall as miracle medications, though some, including Dr. Pelham, raised concerns about their efficacy and side effects.

Dr. Pelham was not opposed to medication. He recognized that drugs were effective at rapidly addressing the symptoms of A.D.H.D., like fidgeting, impulsiveness and lack of concentration. But in a long string of studies and papers, he argued that for most children, behavioral therapy, combined with parental intervention techniques, should be the first line of attack, followed by low doses of drugs if necessary.

And yet, as he pointed out repeatedly, the reality was far different: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2016 that while six in 10 children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. were on medication, fewer than half received behavioral therapy.

In one major study, which he published in 2016 along with Susan Murphy, a statistician at the University of Michigan, he demonstrated the importance of treatment sequencing — that behavioral therapy should come first, then medication.

He and Dr. Murphy split a group of 146 children with A.D.H.D., from ages 5 to 12, into two groups. One group received a low dose of generic Ritalin; the other received nothing, but their parents were given instruction in behavioral-modification techniques.

After two months, children from both groups who showed no improvement were arranged into four new groups. The children given generic Ritalin received either more medication or behavioral modification therapy, and the children given behavioral modification therapy received either more intense therapy or a dose of medication.

“We showed that the sequence in which you give treatments makes a big difference in outcomes,” Dr. Pelham told The New York Times. “The children who started with behavioral modification were doing significantly better than those who began with medication by the end, no matter what treatment combination they ended up with.”

Not everyone agreed with Dr. Pelham’s conclusions; many disagreed on practical grounds. Medication was easy to administer, they said, and proper behavioral therapy could be time-consuming and expensive and therefore hard to maintain over a long stretch of time, both for parents and for children — especially teenagers, who were more likely to resist it.

Dr. Pelham’s influence can perhaps best be seen in the 2019 guidelines for A.D.H.D. diagnosis and treatment issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the group’s most recent recommendations. For very young children, it recommends treatment first, with medication as an option; for children 6 to 12, it recommends both simultaneously. But for adolescents, it concludes that behavioral treatment is unproven, and recommends medication only.

Dr. Pelham began his career at Washington State University but spent most of it at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In 2010 he moved his research program, the Center for Children and Families, to Florida International University, in Miami.

At both schools he ran an innovative summer camp for children with A.D.H.D. and associated disorders. The camp, which he created in 1980, served as a space for both therapy and research. It has since been the model for similar programs nationwide and internationally, including in Japan.

“Dr. Pelham was one of the original giants in the field of A.D.H.D. research,” Dr. James McGough, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a phone interview.

William Ellerbe Pelham Jr. was born on Jan. 22, 1948, in Atlanta, the son of William and Kittie Copeland (Kay) Pelham. The family moved often for William Sr.'s work, first to Kensington, Md., where he managed a Canada Dry facility, and later to Montgomery, Ala., where he sold securities. His mother was a homemaker and an artist.

William Jr. received a bachelor's degree in psychology from Dartmouth in 1970. He spent a year teaching special education in Amsterdam, N.Y., northwest of Albany, before enrolling in the doctoral program in psychology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, on Long Island. He received his Ph.D. in 1976.

In addition to his son, Dr. Pelham is survived by his wife, Maureen (Cullinan) Pelham, whom he married in 1990; his daughter, Caroline Pelham; and his brothers, Gayle and John.

Dr. Pelham insisted on a therapy-first approach in part because it equipped children with the skills they needed to manage what was often a lifelong struggle.

“Our research has found time and time again that behavioral and educational intervention is the best first-line treatment for children with A.D.H.D.,” he said in an interview for the podcast “The Academic Minute” in 2022. “They, their teachers and parents learn skills and strategies that will help them succeed at home, in school and in their relationships.”"
"Vaping Declines Among High School Students, Survey Shows

The Latest
The number of high school students who reported using e-cigarettes fell to 10 percent in the spring of this year from 14 percent last year, according to the results of an annual survey released on Thursday by federal health agencies.

Vaping rose just slightly among middle school students, to 4.6 percent this year from 3.3 percent in 2022. The use of traditional cigarettes among high school students remained at a record low of less than 2 percent.

The decline in high school vaping rates was “encouraging,” said Linda Neff, an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the lead author on the latest survey report. But she said the results for older teenagers were tempered by very small increases in middle school students reporting tobacco use.

What’s Behind the Numbers: Flavor bans may have had an effect.
One thing is clear about underage e-cigarette use: Adolescents like flavors. About 90 percent of the students who reported vaping said they used flavored products, citing favorites that tasted like fruit and candy.

Teenagers identified Elf Bar and Esco Bar as their favorite brands, well-known for flavors like strawberry kiwi and watermelon ice.

Public health advocates in California recognized the allure, leading to a yearslong fight to pass a ban on flavored tobacco products, which took effect in December. It quickly led to falling sales, according to data from the C.D.C. Foundation. From December 2022 to June of this year, flavored e-cigarette sales fell by nearly 70 percent, to 179,000 from about 575,000 vapes or refills.

The ban no doubt made it harder for young people to buy vapes in California, where you must be 21 to buy tobacco products.

Public health experts also linked other state and local flavor bans and education campaigns to the falling high school vaping rate, which is the lowest in nearly a decade. And a few years ago, under public pressure, Juul, which had once been the most popular brand, withdrew most of its flavors from the market.

The survey was given in about 180 schools nationwide, and was released by the C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration. It reported on e-cigarette use in the last 30 days but did not include any state-specific information.

In all, about 2.1 million middle and high school students reported using e-cigarettes, down from 2.5 million last year. But surveys conducted during a few previous years since the peak of the vaping crisis in 2019 have carried notes of caution about drawing strict comparisons year-to-year because of pandemic conditions when students were in and out of school.

Why It Matters: Studies identify health risks of vaping for teenagers.
Federal officials who regulate e-cigarettes see their use as an aid in helping adult smokers quit traditional cigarettes, given the well-known cancer risks.

But e-cigarette use has become wildly popular among nonsmokers. About 40 percent of people who use e-cigarettes are under 25, including many who started when Juul was first introduced. A majority of those young people never smoked before vaping, according to the C.D.C.

The health effects are well known by now. One recent University of Southern California study noted the toxicity of the chemicals in e-cigarettes and sent questionnaires to adolescents who vaped. It found significant increases in wheezing, shortness of breath and bronchitis symptoms. And many experts have expressed concerns about the effect of nicotine addiction on the adolescent’s developing brain.

What’s Next: A proposed menthol ban and heightened enforcement of illegal imports.
The F.D.A. is moving toward a ban on menthol cigarettes and is advancing a proposal to drastically cut nicotine levels in cigarettes. That has led legacy tobacco companies to embrace e-cigarette sales as the way forward in the marketplace to offset overall declining cigarette sales.

Yet those companies — along with many lawmakers in Congress and antismoking groups — say they have been dismayed with what they consider lax enforcement by the F.D.A. While the agency has authorized about two dozen vaping products for sale, thousands of illicit candy-colored flavored vapes have flooded the country and are top sellers.

The F.D.A. said it would press ahead with its enforcement efforts, including its import ban on Elf Bar and Esco Bar products and fines on retailers who continue to sell them. The agency has issued warning letters to makers of those vapes and many others.

Brian King, the F.D.A.’s tobacco division chief, welcomed the findings, but said: “We can’t rest on our laurels. There’s more work to be done to build on this progress.”

Dr. Neff said her agency needed to better understand why there was a small but significant increase in middle school use of any tobacco product, to 6.6 percent this year from 4.5 percent last year.

“Our work is far from done,” Dr. Neff said.

Other researchers noted that the combined general use of tobacco products by middle and high school students barely fell, to 10 percent this year from 11 percent last year. “On balance, it’s no change in the overall youth tobacco use,” said Karen Knudsen, chief executive of the American Cancer Society. “And that’s concerning.”"
"Infant Deaths Have Risen for the First Time in 20 Years
The increases were particularly stark among babies born to Native American, Alaska Native and white mothers in 2022. Rates among Black infants remained highest of all.

The number of American babies who died before their first birthdays rose last year, significantly increasing the nation’s infant mortality rate for the first time in two decades, according to provisional figures released Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics.

The spike is a somber manifestation of the state of maternal and child health in the United States. Infant and maternal mortality, inextricably linked, are widely considered to be markers of a society’s overall health, and America’s rates are higher than those in other industrialized countries.

The rates are particularly poor among Black and Native American mothers, who are roughly three times as likely to die during and after pregnancy, compared with white and Hispanic mothers. Their infants face up to double the risk of dying, compared with white and Hispanic babies.

Overall life expectancy has declined in the United States in recent years, too, affecting white Americans as well as people of color. The declines were driven in part by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The increase in infant mortality comes after a century of public health improvements, in which rates consistently and gradually declined almost every year with few exceptions, said Danielle M. Ely, a health statistician with the N.C.H.S. and the report’s lead author.

The report did not delve into the cause of the increase, but most of the babies born in 2022 were conceived in 2021, when maternal deaths rose by 40 percent because of the pandemic and many pregnant women were taken ill.

“Seeing an increase that hits the statistical significance mark indicates that this was a bigger jump than we’ve had in the last 20 years, and that is something we need to keep an eye on to see if it’s just a one-year anomaly or the start of increasing rates,” Dr. Ely said.

One of the more disturbing findings in the new report was an increase in infant mortality among babies born to women ages 25 to 29. The rate increased to 5.37 per 1,000 live births last year, up from 5.15 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021. The cause is not known.

Rates did not change for women in other age groups, even those who generally experience higher infant mortality rates, such as women younger than 20, those 20 to 24 and women 40 and older.

Dr. Elizabeth Cherot, an OB-GYN who is president and chief executive of the March of Dimes, said she was surprised and disappointed by the new infant mortality figures, and called for taking a much closer look at the data to try to identify the underlying causes.

“We were making strides, but these trends are clearly going in the wrong direction,” she said.

The rise occurred at the tail end of the pandemic, after a year that had a sharp increase in maternal mortality and maternal illness, she added. Pregnancy complications are now more prevalent, as more women begin pregnancies with underlying medical conditions like high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes.

Serious complications that pose a risk to both mother and baby, like pre-eclampsia, also have become more common. But it is difficult to pin the rise in infant mortality on any one factor, she added, without examining the data in more detail.

“We were just coming out of Covid,” Dr. Cherot said. “We were doing a lot of telemedicine. Did that shift something? Were protocols changing? Was access a bigger issue? We know mental health can also have an impact. A lot of things changed in the last three years.”

For families who lose a baby, the death can be life altering.

Erika Nolting Young’s baby died less than two hours after birth. Ms. Young, 37, a business strategy consultant in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., had experienced a normal, healthy pregnancy, with no sign at any point that something was wrong.

She expected to deliver on Aug. 17, 2022, and when labor did not start spontaneously, made plans to be induced a week later. But just hours before Ms. Young and her husband, Kris, were supposed to go to the hospital, they received a call saying that the maternity ward was full and there were not enough nurses, so she would have to wait.

The hospital called her in the next day, and began the induction with a drug that caused intense labor and rapid progression to full dilation.

In the final stage of labor, the monitors picked up a deceleration in the baby’s heart rate — and then a sudden further deceleration.

The baby was born “really gray and floppy,” Ms. Young recalled. “They threw her on my chest for a split second, and her eyes were closed. I knew something was wrong instantly.”

Doctors tried to save the newborn, a girl who was named Sommer, but she died shortly afterward, Ms. Young said: “We went home to a house with a baby room and no baby.” The Youngs still do not know what caused Sommer’s death.

Some 20,538 infants like Sommer died in 2022, representing a 3 percent increase over the 19,928 babies who died in 2021. The infant mortality rate — defined as the number of babies who die before they are a year old for every 1,000 live births — also increased by a statistically significant 3 percent last year, to 5.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, up from 5.44 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021, according to the new report.

The mortality rate of babies who were between 4 weeks and a year old increased by 4 percent, while neonatal mortality rates — that of babies less than a month old — increased by 3 percent.

Rates increased significantly among both premature babies born before 37 weeks of gestation and those born extremely early, at less than 34 weeks of gestation.

Overall, the statistically significant increases in mortality rates were seen only among male infants, whose survival rates have always been slightly lower than those among females.

Black infants have the highest mortality rate in the United States, rising slightly last year to 10.86 deaths per 1,000 live births, from 10.55 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021, an increase that was not statistically significant.

By contrast, the infant mortality rates of both white and Native American and Alaska Native babies increased by statistically significant amounts last year.

Among white infants, the figure rose to 4.52 deaths per 1,000 live births from 4.36 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021. Among Native American and Alaska Native babies, the figure increased to 9.06 deaths per 1,000 live births from 7.46 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021.

The two leading causes of infant deaths that were more prevalent last year were bacterial sepsis, caused by the body’s overwhelming reaction to an infection, and maternal health complications.

Since infant deaths are relatively rare events involving small numbers of babies, statistically significant changes cannot easily be seen from year to year at the state level. Nevada was the only state that had a statistically significant decline in infant mortality, while four states — Georgia, Iowa, Missouri and Texas — experienced statistically significant increases in infant mortality last year.

Texas banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy in 2021, the first of the four states to do so. But in interviews on Wednesday, experts said the data was unclear as to whether, or to what extent, this may have played a role in infant deaths the following year. The other states implemented bans in 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade."
"Second Maryland Man to Receive an Altered Pig’s Heart Has Died
Researchers said they found signs of organ rejection, which the genetically modified tissue was supposed to prevent.

A 58-year-old man with heart failure who received a new heart from a genetically modified pig died on Monday, nearly six weeks after receiving the pig organ, University of Maryland Medical Center officials announced on Tuesday.

Lawrence Faucette, of Frederick, Md., was the second patient at the medical center to have had an ailing heart replaced with one from a pig that had been genetically modified so its organs would be more compatible with a human recipient and would not be rejected by the human immune system.

The first patient, 57-year-old David Bennett, died last year, two months after his transplant. He had developed multiple complications, and traces of a virus that infects pigs were found in his new heart.

Both of the patients had terminal heart disease when they received the transplanted organs, and neither managed to recover sufficiently to leave the hospital. But while doctors said that Mr. Bennett did not show any signs of acute rejection of the new heart, which is the most significant risk in organ transplants, they said that Mr. Faucette’s transplanted heart had started to display some initial signs of rejection.

“We mourn the loss of Mr. Faucette, a remarkable patient, scientist, Navy veteran and family man, who just wanted a little more time to spend with his loving wife, sons and family,” said Dr. Bartley P. Griffith, the surgeon who performed the transplant at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore.

Mr. Faucette was very engaged in his own care, reading and interpreting his own biopsies, said Dr. Muhammad M. Mohiuddin, a professor of surgery and the scientific program director of the cardiac xenotransplantation program at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

“Mr. Faucette’s last wish was for us to make the most of what we have learned from our experience, so others may be guaranteed a chance for a new heart when a human organ is unavailable,” Dr. Griffith said.

After the surgery, the transplanted heart performed well, with no signs of rejection during the first month, and Mr. Faucette was able to do physical therapy with the aim of regaining his ability to walk, according to a statement from the University of Maryland.

Like Mr. Bennett, the first patient to receive a pig’s heart, Mr. Faucette was rejected from transplant programs that use a traditional organ from a deceased human donor. He was too sick, suffering from advanced heart failure as well as peripheral vascular disease and other complications.

He was in end-stage heart failure on Sept. 14 when he was admitted to the University of Maryland Medical Center, and shortly before the surgery, his heart stopped and he had to be resuscitated.

His wife, Ann Faucette, said at that time that the couple was keeping expectations low, and hoping only for some more time to sit “on the front porch” and have coffee together.

After his death, Ms. Faucette said that her husband was a kind and selfless man who hoped his experience would help save lives by advancing the field of xenotransplantation, or the transplantation of organs or tissues from an animal source into a human recipient.

“He knew his time with us was short, and this was his last chance to do for others,” she said in a statement.

Transplant surgeons at a number of medical centers have been working fervently to advance the field of xenotransplantation. Most of the work so far has involved transplanting kidneys from genetically modified pigs into brain-dead patients being maintained on ventilators, in order to demonstrate that the kidneys can make urine and perform other essential biological functions without being rejected.

More than 100,000 Americans are living with end-stage organ disease, and there is an acute shortage of human donor organs. Most of those waiting for an organ need a kidney, but fewer than 25,000 kidney transplants are done each year and thousands die while on the waiting list."
"Panel Says That Innovative Sickle Cell Cure Is Safe Enough for Patients
The decision by an advisory committee may lead to Food and Drug Administration approval of the first treatment for humans that uses the CRISPR gene-editing system.

A panel of experts said on Tuesday that a groundbreaking treatment for sickle cell disease was safe enough for clinical use, setting the stage for likely federal approval by Dec. 8 of a powerful potential cure for an illness that afflicts more than 100,000 Americans.

The Food and Drug Administration had previously found that the treatment, known as exa-cel and jointly developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals of Boston and CRISPR Therapeutics of Switzerland, was effective. The panel’s conclusion on Tuesday about exa-cel’s safety sends it to the F.D.A. for a decision on greenlighting it for broad patient use.

Exa-cel frees patients from the debilitating and painful effects of this chronic, deadly disease. If approved, the Vertex product would be the first medicine to treat a genetic disease with the CRISPR gene-editing technique.

It could also be the first of a series of new options to cure the excruciating illness. By Dec. 20, the F.D.A. will decide on a second potential cure for sickle cell, a gene therapy devised by the company Bluebird Bio of Somerville, Mass.

Sickle cell disease is caused by a gene mutation that makes blood cells misshapen, so that they resemble sickles or crescents. It affects millions of people worldwide, most of whom have African ancestry. The misshapen cells get stuck in blood vessels, causing strokes, organ damage and episodes of agonizing pain as muscles are starved of oxygen.

Sickle cell’s toll starts early in life. Evelyn Islam of Milwaukee, now 8, had 22 blood transfusions and had to have her spleen removed before she was 3. “Gene therapy is our last hope for a cure,” said her mother, Melissa Nicole Allen.

But the new gene therapies will come too late for many.

Ashley Valentine, a co-founder of the national advocacy group Sick Cells, had to take three months off from work in 2016 to help her brother Marqus deal with symptoms of sickle cell. When he had a hip replacement in 2018, her father ended up accepting a layoff from his job to help care for him.

“And that’s just us,” she said.

Marqus died in 2020, at age 36, from a stroke caused by sickle cell.

New treatments like the one that was endorsed on Tuesday are expected to cost millions of dollars per patient, though Vertex has not yet said what it will charge. But lifelong care for patients with the disease is also enormously expensive, costing the health care system an estimated $3 billion a year.

It’s not yet clear how many people will seek the new therapy. The new therapies are also not easy to endure and come with hardships for patients, who will have to undergo chemotherapy and spend more than a month in the hospital. Family members are affected too — they may need to take time off work during the most intensive phase of the treatment.

Understand Sickle Cell Disease
The rare blood disorder, which can cause debilitating pain, strokes and organ failure, affects 100,000 Americans and millions of people globally, mostly in Africa.
 A New Hope: The F.D.A. approves new therapies for the disease, including one that uses CRISPR, but the obstacles to treatments are myriad.
 On the Edge of Fear: Only a small fraction of patients are expected to receive one of these treatments for the disease, which in the United States mostly affects Black people.
Preventing Complications: A legacy of neglect toward Americans with the disease means that patients may not receive the treatments needed to stave off the disease’s risks.
The Global Epicenter: In Nigeria, where 150,000 babies are born each year with sickle cell disease, the effects of the condition are pervasive and devastating.
Additionally, most Americans with sickle cell are Black and may not trust a health care system that has often failed to provide the most basic preventive and therapeutic care for those with the disease. Some with sickle cell are anxious about undergoing a medical treatment that is on the cutting edge of biotechnology.

But for doctors who have spent years watching patients suffer, and many parents who have seen their children endure years of agony, there is elation at what lies ahead.

“We are finally at a spot where we can envision broadly available cures for sickle cell disease,” said Dr. John Tisdale, director of the cellular and molecular therapeutics branch at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and a member of the advisory committee.

Dana Jones of San Antonio wants her daughters Kyra, 18, and Kami, 20, to have a chance at one of the new therapies. Both had strokes that left them with learning disabilities — injuries that could probably have been avoided if they had been given a screening test and treatment long known to prevent nine out of 10 strokes in children with the disease. Kyra is now in intensive care as doctors try to control her pain.

Ms. Jones is overwhelmed by the possibility that her daughters could be cured.

“It is my prayer that Kami and Kyra can be cured of this awful disease and finally be able to truly live,” she said.

A New Treatment and a New Technology

The cause of sickle cell has been known for nearly 70 years, but research lagged, a situation many say occurred at least in part because so many patients were Black and from poor and working-class families.

There are a number of treatments to reduce sickle cell’s impact. Some patients are able to get bone marrow transplants that can cure the condition. But that requires finding a donor and, after the transplant, taking drugs to prevent the body from rejecting the foreign cells.

In recent years, a number of biotechnology companies have tried novel approaches. While Bluebird Bio is advancing its gene therapy technique, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics focused on the gene-editing system CRISPR-Cas9, which can home in on specific areas of DNA and turn genes on or off. CRISPR has allowed researchers to disable genes to assess their importance in biomedical research. But until now it has not been used as a treatment for patients with a genetic disease.

To treat sickle cell, CRISPR snips a piece of DNA in bone marrow stem cells. That frees a blocked gene to make a form of hemoglobin that normally is produced only by a fetus. The fetal gene directs the production of hemoglobin that does not form into the sickle shape. In clinical trials, patients no longer had the complications of sickle cell disease and no longer needed blood transfusions.

But there is a concern that CRISPR could inadvertently snip a piece of DNA in the wrong part of a patient’s genome. That might disrupt a gene and cause a blood cancer.

No such issues have turned up in the clinical trials, but the Vertex trial involved only 44 patients, and just 30 have been followed for at least 16 months. The company did extensive comparisons of patients’ DNA with that of people in large databases asking how likely such CRISPR misfires could be.

Vertex said it plans to follow clinical trial patients for 15 years. The company’s data were sufficiently reassuring that the expert committee said on Tuesday they saw no reason to hold the treatment back.

There can always be additional studies, noted committee member Alexis Komor, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. But, she said, that would be “expecting perfection at the expense of progress.”

Dr. Joseph Wu of Stanford added, “We all agree that the benefits outweigh the risks. These patients are quite sick and this is a good therapy.”

Scot Wolfe of the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School said, “We want to be careful not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”

“There is a huge unmet need,” he added.

If It’s Safe, Who Gets It?

Vertex estimates that 20,000 people could be eligible for its treatment, and says Medicaid and private insurers have suggested a willingness to pay for it.

“There is almost no way they could not pay,” said Dr. David Williams, chief of the division of hematology and oncology at Boston Children’s Hospital.

Dr. Williams, who has consulted for Vertex and Bluebird Bio, added that insurers pay “$3 million a pop” for other gene therapies produced by Bluebird Bio for the diseases thalassemia and adrenoleukodystrophy. With sickle cell, and its large number of Black patients, he said, there is an issue of “equity in access and the tremendous medical need.”

Some people with the disease may not be eligible, depending on the F.D.A.’s decisions. They could include young children with sickle cell and older patients whose bodies have been so damaged that the treatment could pose heightened risks.

Kevin Wake of Kansas City, Mo., hopes he is not too old, at 55, or too damaged. He has had three strokes caused by the disease.

The treatments, though curative, are difficult.

Patients first have eight weeks of blood transfusions followed by a treatment to release bone marrow stem cells into their bloodstream. The stem cells are then removed and sent to the companies to be treated. Next, patients receive intense chemotherapy to clear their marrows for the treated cells. The treated cells are infused back into the patients, but they have to remain in the hospital for at least a month while the new cells grow and repopulate their marrows.

That treatment “cannot be delivered at most hospitals,” said Dr. Alexis Thompson, chief of the division of hematology at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who consults for Vertex.

Another issue is how quickly Vertex can ramp up production. Each patient’s cells must be treated individually in a sterile environment, an arduous prospect.

Stuart Arbuckle, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Vertex, is confident. “We are launch ready,” he said. But he added that he did not expect a huge wave of patients immediately.

“This is a pretty big decision for a patient to go through,” Mr. Arbuckle said.

One of the Vertex clinical trial patients, Marie-Chantal Tornyenu, 22, who is a senior at Cornell University, said patients also had to be prepared for “mental adjustment” after treatment.

Ms. Tornyenu said she no longer had the pain crises that plagued her, especially in high school when she was hospitalized nearly every month.

But she has spent much of her life taking precautions and worrying about pain and complications from sickle cell. Those habits are hard to break.

“It’s a major learning curve from having sickle cell my whole life,” she said. “I’m still struggling with that mind-set — ‘sickle cell is you.’”"
"Bariatric Surgery at 16
If childhood obesity is an ‘epidemic,’ how far should doctors go to treat it?

Last fall, Alexandra Duarte, who is now 16, went to see her endocrinologist at Texas Children’s Hospital, outside Houston. From age 10, she had been living with polycystic ovary syndrome and, more recently, prediabetes. After Alexandra described her recent quinceañera, the doctor brought up an operation that might benefit her, one that might help her lose weight and, as a result, improve these obesity-related problems.

Alexandra, who smiles shyly and speaks softly but confidently, says she was “a little skeptical at first because, like, it’s a surgery.” But her mother, Gabriela Velez, suggested that her daughter consider it. “Ever since I was a toddler, my mom knew that I was struggling with obesity,” Alexandra says.

Through the years, Alexandra seemed to have tried everything. She went through periods when she avoided all carbs and days when she drank only water. She turned to commercial products, from Herbalife to diet pills to meal-replacement shakes. Desperation — and hope — led her to try gimmicky lotions that promised to burn fat. Puberty seemed to make things worse. Her doctors dispensed “basically the same talk everyone else gives me,” she says: Follow the government’s MyPlate plan; eat lots of vegetables; have anything, but don’t overdo it.

Her mother diligently prepared her meals, cooking vegetables in ways that she liked. Alexandra herself worked on “getting fuller on less,” trying to limit each meal to a single plateful. Almost everyone in her immediate family carries extra weight — including her younger twin brothers, who put on more weight during the pandemic — but neither her father nor the twins nor another brother copied her efforts. Seeing them eat ice cream and cake made her vegetables less enticing. “I have a huge sweet tooth,” she says.

The teasing started in fifth grade. Alexandra couldn’t eat without her classmates staring at and judging her. Though she sought counseling for her sadness and anxiety, these troubles still caused her to leave school for a month. The bullying finally stopped after she switched schools in 10th grade, but Alexandra’s parents knew how deeply she continued to suffer. How much more could their daughter endure? After the doctor suggested bariatric surgery, an operation on the gastrointestinal tract that helps patients lose weight, they spoke to friends who had successfully been through the procedure as adults. They decided it was a smart option for her. Alexandra wasn’t sure, however.

When the family met the surgeon, Jose Ruben Rodriguez, he was quick to tell them that the operation was no “shortcut.” Indeed, Alexandra first had to complete the hospital’s strict, comprehensive behavior and lifestyle program, which lasts six to nine months; this effort would demonstrate her commitment to improving her health while also preparing her for surgery and life afterward. Many teenagers find this step too challenging: Rodriguez estimates that less than one-third of them end up receiving the surgery after their initial appointment. For Alexandra, the program’s tasks mimicked what she had tried already: keeping food journals, drinking more water, setting sleep schedules (which in turn often means restricting access to phones). She was also instructed to exercise; as someone who loves dancing to K-pop songs in her bedroom and going to the gym with friends, Alexandra didn’t find that difficult, either. “I guess for some people it could be intense,” she says, “but it honestly to me felt a little bit easy.”

Alexandra also saw a dietitian, a psychologist, a gynecologist and a social worker. She was tested too: blood draws, ultrasound, X-rays, sleep study. With each appointment, she felt increasingly comfortable with the prospect of an operation. It was especially helpful to hear Rodriguez explain the procedure, called a sleeve gastrectomy, and describe the experiences of other teenagers who had been through it. After several months of deliberating, she decided to go ahead. The other would-be fixes “never really solved the problem,” Alexandra says. “No matter how many pounds I lose, I gain it back. And it’s sometimes even more. It made me feel discouraged with my efforts, like maybe I wasn’t trying hard enough.”

Alexandra is one of the roughly 20 percent of children in the United States living with obesity, up from 5 percent in the 1970s. Another 16 percent or so are considered overweight. The prevalence of obesity increases as children get older: to more than 22 percent among adolescents from around 13 percent in 2-to-5-year-olds. At 5-foot-1 and 209 pounds, Alexandra had a body mass index that placed her well above the threshold for severe obesity, which is 120 percent of the 95th percentile, according to the C.D.C.’s Extended B.M.I.-for-Age Growth Chart. Without treatment, Alexandra would almost inevitably have obesity into adulthood. And the longer that continued, the more at risk she would be for chronic health issues, like joint pain and problems with breathing and sleeping. Worse, some children in her situation can develop what were once considered adult illnesses: hypertension, diabetes, fatty liver disease. Obesity can also magnify mental-health problems. Teenagers with obesity are more likely than those without obesity to contemplate suicide.

Severe obesity is the fastest-rising subcategory among youth — “an epidemic within an epidemic,” as the American Academy of Pediatrics calls it. During the pandemic, the rate of increase in children’s B.M.I. doubled; the greatest gains were in those who were already overweight. Worldwide, the rates of pediatric obesity, which is not solely an American affliction, could double by 2035.

In response to so many grim facts, the A.A.P. in January released its first “clinical practice guideline” for those who care for children who have obesity. The academy now recommends that they immediately start “intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment,” which it labels “the foundation” of obesity management; this approach supersedes the former strategy of “watchful waiting.” For older youth in certain circumstances — those with a higher B.M.I., say — drugs and, in cases of severe obesity, surgery should be made available as options. “The guideline supports what the evidence supports,” Sarah Hampl, its lead author, told me, when she described the yearslong review process. “We didn’t go beyond that.”

Semaglutide, one of the newest drugs being used for weight loss, was approved for adolescents 12 and older at the end of December, shortly before the A.A.P. guidelines were released. (Ozempic is the brand name of one semaglutide formulation that has dominated headlines and social media for its off-label use in helping adults swiftly and effortlessly shed pounds.) The drugs seem to offer a promising remedy, though it is too early to know if their use among adolescents will be as widespread. Also, it is unclear if the drugs will be sufficient to treat severe obesity; for now, surgery, a treatment of longer standing whose rates have increased substantially among teenagers over the last decade, remains the most effective intervention for them.

As soon as the recommendations were announced, they were met with fierce criticism for their screening and treatment methods, especially drugs like semaglutide and the surgery Alexandra opted for. Critics claimed that these approaches are far too aggressive and subject children’s bodies to unnecessary scrutiny and manipulation, potentially distorting how they view themselves, and that treatments could lead to eating disorders that cause more damage than obesity itself. Some critics challenged B.M.I. — a controversial measurement — and argued that doctors should not be diagnosing obesity in children at all. But, Hampl emphasizes, “the decision for treatment is really in the hands of the families,” rather than the doctors.

In June, grasping her white stuffed puppy with floppy ears and her red blanket printed with gray hedgehogs, Alexandra waited in the pre-op area. She was nervous, but “not as nervous as she is,” she said, pointing to her mother. Gabriela nodded and said, “I think I’m thinking too much.” Alexandra’s father sat quietly beside her as she tried to keep busy by drawing in her sketchbook, eventually burying her face in her stuffed animal.

The tenacity of body weight can be traced to our biology. Humans evolved to resist losing body fat so that we don’t become extinct, says Rudolph Leibel, chief of the pediatric molecular genetics division at Columbia University’s medical center. Scientists are still trying to unravel that evolutionary process. According to the “thrifty gene” hypothesis, which has been around for over a half-century, we gain weight (and keep it on) to help us prepare for and survive periodic famines. In 2008, John Speakman, an eminent British biologist, coined the “drifty gene” hypothesis: As human survival came to depend less on escaping predators, random gene mutations allowed our upper weight limits to drift higher. Today our brains may be regulating our body weight so that it stays within a range between upper and lower thresholds — while perhaps fighting harder to keep us above the bottom one. After all, starvation poses more immediate danger than obesity. “You cannot get a person to chronically defend a lower level of body fat by chronically restricting their calories,” Leibel says. But, he adds, that level may be pushed up “by virtue of environment.”

Our brains are “nonconsciously defending that higher weight,” Stephan Guyenet, a neurobiologist and the author of “The Hungry Brain,” told me — and they are even capable of slowing down our metabolism to that end. The hypothalamus, seated deep in our brains, is the master of this tightly regulated system. Cone-shaped and no larger than an almond, it’s involved in determining if we’re hungry and accordingly prompts us to increase our food intake, or if we’re satisfied, decrease it. It also helps control our metabolism. The hypothalamus responds to signals sent from parts of the body including our fat cells and guts — signals like leptin, an important hormone that Leibel helped discover, which increases when body fat rises, telling our brains to stop eating.

A small number of children with severe obesity are born with leptin deficiency, a gene mutation identified by Sadaf Farooqi, a professor at the University of Cambridge’s Institute of Metabolic Science. Their appetites seem to be bottomless. Though it’s rare, Farooqi cites the extreme effect of this mutation as a clear illustration of the “very strong” impact that biology has upon appetite. When Farooqi treated children with this deficiency by injecting them with leptin, they reduced their consumption; too much leptin made them stop eating entirely. “We can literally control how much they’re eating by the dose of leptin we’re giving them,” she says. In other words, appetite is not entirely within our conscious control or willpower. Ghrelin, a hunger hormone, increases when food intake is restricted, making us eat more. Insulin, another important hormone, helps turn the food we eat into energy and controls things like blood sugar that influence how much we eat.

“Hunger is absolutely instinctual,” Guyenet told me. “We don’t decide whether we’re going to be hungry or not, whether we’re going to have a craving or not.” And while we might be able to control our intake for a meal or a week, we probably can’t do so every time we eat, for a lifetime. Even our brain’s reward system, which interacts closely with the hypothalamus, motivates us to seek high-calorie food. “There’s just a lot of different ways your brain can kind of sneak calories,” he says. “These regulatory systems have their tendrils everywhere.”

Genetics may determine more than 70 percent of children’s body weight. Single-gene mutations are extremely rare (the most common one affects up to 5 percent of children with severe obesity); Farooqi says that nearly all children with obesity are living with the “cumulative effect of many different genetic variants, resulting in a bigger appetite.” So far, about 1,000 have been identified, most of which act on appetite and hunger, and there are probably many thousands more. Each variant might have a very slight impact — the strongest might be responsible for one person being five pounds heavier than the next — but, Farooqi says, “when you add them up together, they probably explain why some people are much more likely to get obese than others.”

But if our genes didn’t change significantly in the last century, why, then, are children getting bigger? No one knows for sure. One likely explanation, however, is the evolutionary mismatch between our genes and our surroundings. Children who end up with obesity were always at the highest genetic risk for that outcome, even if it wasn’t certain to develop, but now, Farooqi says, “the environment is likely unmasking their genetic susceptibility.” The most substantial transformation in their surroundings has been to the food they eat, which in the past was different in its composition and far more limited. Leibel refers to “a revolution in human environments” and notes that our genes haven’t changed “fast enough to accommodate something that’s really an invention of the past 75 years.” The amount of readily accessible food has expanded immensely, making it easier than ever to eat — open a phone app, say, or go to a drive-through. Plenty of Americans can consume as much as they want, whenever they want.

Today nearly 70 percent of what children eat is ultraprocessed food, which the NOVA classification system, a commonly used framework, defines as having been formulated from “ingredients mostly of exclusive industrial use, typically created by series of industrial techniques and processes” — which makes them extremely flavorful. These foodstuffs include things our great-grandparents would not have consumed: packaged chips, energy drinks, ready-to-heat-and-eat meals. They are thought to be an important driver of the childhood-obesity epidemic, in part because they seem to make us eat more. Kevin Hall, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health, found that even when meals are matched for calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, sugar, salt and fiber, study participants who are instructed to eat freely will still, without realizing it, consume an average of 500 calories more a day if the food is ultraprocessed.

“Any kid is going to choose an ultraprocessed food,” says Marion Nestle, an emerita professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at N.Y.U. and the author of “Food Politics.” Nestle traces the deregulation of food marketing to the Reagan presidency and the shareholder-value movement. “After 1980, kids were fair game,” she told me. Corporations began aggressively marketing their products to children, potential lifetime customers who are easily influenced. Ultraprocessed foods appeal to parents too: They’re cheap, last for years in pantries and freezers and require little preparation. “All food companies are trying to sell products,” Nestle says. “That’s the system, and if the system makes kids fat, well, too bad. Collateral damage.”

In the United States, that damage is inflicted more harshly on some groups of children than others: The obesity epidemic disproportionately spares white and Asian children and those from socioeconomically advantaged families. Living in the highest-opportunity neighborhoods, especially at birth, could be associated with as much as an 80 percent lower risk of obesity. Among Black children, however, the protective effect of income against obesity seems to be weaker.

Over the past few decades, the variety of food items in some supermarkets has risen to more than 40,000 from 7,000. These “modern industrial products should not be recognized as foods at all,” says David Ludwig, a pediatrics professor at Harvard and co-director of Boston Children’s Hospital’s obesity-prevention center. “It’s up to parents and all of us to fight back and not to normalize these.” The A.A.P. urges doctors to “demand more of our government” to modify the food being sold to children. But Barry Popkin, a nutrition professor at the University of North Carolina who has worked with countries on their food policies, remains skeptical that similar regulations could be enacted soon in the United States, like Colombia’s tax on ultraprocessed foods or Chile’s restrictions on them in schools and on advertising. “We need our F.D.A. to be bold,” Popkin says. “We need a food czar who’s tough, not these namby-pamby bureaucrats that don’t really want to ruffle any feathers.”

At Texas Children’s Hospital, Alexandra lay asleep in the operating room, on a tilted bed, with her feet lower than her head. Gravity now worked to the surgeon’s advantage, pulling her intestines away from her stomach. Rodriguez, wearing a “Peanuts”-themed cap with his scrubs, made five half-inch incisions throughout her abdomen, while the music of Bruno Mars and Elton John softly played in the O.R. Rodriguez then inserted a camera and his tools through the cuts. Alexandra’s insides appeared on four surrounding screens.

Rodriguez pulled back her liver, its edges rounded from fat, and pushed aside mounds of squishy yellow fat — findings that he sees only in his bariatric patients — to reveal her stomach, pink and patterned with red vessels like fine tree branches. The anesthesiologist had snaked a tube through Alexandra’s mouth into her stomach. Rodriguez could now follow the contour of the tube with a surgical device that sequentially cut, stapled and sutured stomach tissue. Next came what Rodriguez regarded as the hardest step, wrestling the excised portion of the organ, about 80 percent of the whole, out through one of the tiny incisions. To make sure that what remained of her stomach had been fully stitched up, the anesthesiologist pumped air through the tube into the organ, which now resembled a slim shirtsleeve — hence the procedure’s name, sleeve gastrectomy — and Rodriguez flushed water into her abdomen: Bubbles would indicate a leak somewhere. The water was still. The operation was completed in under an hour. Most of Alexandra’s stomach now sat on a tray, cool and dusky.

In another room, with children’s artwork adorning the bright aqua walls, Alexandra’s parents sat on orange chairs and waited, until Rodriguez came in and knelt next to them. “There’s no blood loss at all, which is nice,” he told them in Spanish. In the postoperative area, Alexandra, still confused from the anesthesia, writhed around. With every movement, she hurt. “It’s so hard to see her like this,” Gabriela said, as she smoothed her hand over her daughter’s forehead and begged her to lie still. Alexandra let out a moan.

“When we first started, the hospital businesspeople told us there’s not enough surgeries to justify building a program,” Rodriguez told me. “Obviously, that’s not how things turned out. It’s the exact opposite.” The number of teenagers who underwent bariatric surgery more than doubled nationwide between 2010 and 2017 and continues to rise. According to Teen-LABS, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health and which has been conducting the most research on the procedure in the United States, adolescents who have had bariatric surgery — most of them white and female — experienced weight loss similar to what adults lost: around 25 percent of their B.M.I. And while nearly 90 percent of these teenagers needed diabetes medications before the operation, none did afterward; five years later, they were more likely to have their diabetes and hypertension in remission compared with people who had surgery as adults. “There’s a greater positive impact for operating on youth with these two conditions than waiting until adulthood,” says Thomas Inge, chair of surgery at Lurie Children’s Hospital, in Chicago, and the principal investigator of Teen-LABS. “You get more out of the same operation.” Even 10 years after the procedure, the data indicates that there are long-term benefits from surgery. Teenagers do not seem to experience more complications than adults.

“Patients lose weight, and they’re less hungry while they’re doing it,” says Randy Seeley, a professor at the University of Michigan who researches the surgery’s effects on a molecular level. Seeley emphasizes that weight loss doesn’t simply result from a newly tiny stomach that limits how much people can eat. Many chemical changes are also responsible, some of which resemble what happens when people are on Ozempic, although these similarities are not thought to be the main mechanism behind surgery’s effectiveness. The crucial roles instead seem to be played by bile acids and antimicrobial peptides in the gut, each of which increase markedly after surgery; Seeley is still sorting out the exact mechanisms of their influence. Also, a majority of the stomach that secretes ghrelin, the hunger hormone, is removed in sleeve gastrectomies. “Why bariatric surgery works so well is because you’re changing lots of things at the same time,” Seeley says.

Most important, bariatric surgery seems to reset, to a lower bound, the body weight that the brain tries to maintain. There is less of the persistent metabolic slowing that accompanies traditional weight loss. Based on fMRI scans, the response to food cues in the brain — around the hypothalamus and in the reward and cognitive-control regions — appears to be different in post-surgical patients than it is for those on low-calorie diets. But how altering the anatomy of the gut changes the brain is still a mysterious phenomenon — mostly “a black box,” Seeley says. And it still seems to surprise everyone, even those who perform the operation. “I’m just a basic gastrointestinal surgeon,” Inge says. “Never thought I’d get to claim to be a brain surgeon. But, hey, that’s where it seems like the impact is.”

Only a tiny fraction of the teenagers with severe obesity who qualify actually receive the operation. The obstacles in front of them are hard to get past: finding a pediatric bariatric surgeon, navigating the long, arduous process of insurance authorization — assuming the procedure is even covered by the insurer. “We’ve seen all sorts of shenanigans for trying to not approve kids,” Inge says.

Some parents, desperate to help their struggling children, feel they have no choice but to pursue treatment without insurance coverage. In 2021, after A’kaysha Studstill tried to take her own life by overdosing, she and her mother, Anastasia, traveled from Florida to Tijuana, Mexico, for bariatric surgery; the trip, including the sleeve gastrectomy, cost around $6,500. “People questioned me taking her out of the country,” Anastasia says. “But you don’t know what I’m dealing with. The bullying — she would shut down for days. She was going to kill herself.” This summer, A’kaysha told me she had lost a third of her weight. Wearing a crisscross black halter top, she beamed while packing up her room to start her freshman year at Florida State University. “There’s always more options than just giving up,” she said. “You don’t have to diet and starve yourself.”

Several studies have shown an increased risk of suicide in adults after bariatric surgery. This association may not be a result of patients already at higher suicide risk, like A’kaysha, choosing to go through with the operation. Meg Zeller, a professor at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital who researches the relationship between mental health and pediatric bariatric surgery and has studied the Teen-LABS cohort, has not found this link, but she cautions that adolescent data is “just a different ballgame” compared with the abundance of long-term data generated by adult cases. Data from eight years out shows that alcohol-use disorder is higher after bariatric surgery, possibly because the operation causes alcohol to be metabolized more slowly. While feelings of stigma and body image can improve, Zeller told me that anxiety or depression may not subside to the extent that diabetes often does. All teenagers experience life changes and increased vulnerability, she explains. “We’re talking about intervening at a time in someone’s life when lots of challenges can exist that are unique to that age group.”

The morning after her operation, Alexandra, her hair in pigtails, shuffled slowly around her hospital room. She steadily took tiny sips of water. “There’s no going back now,” she said.

If our biology, ingrained by evolution, is no longer well engineered for our modern surroundings, can pharmaceuticals help redesign us? One medicine that Alexandra took, metformin, which reduces glucose, has a moderate benefit for teenagers like her who also have prediabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. But the latest glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists — as a group, commonly referred to as Ozempic — are the true game changers, a class of drugs that are making possible a degree of weight loss not seen before with medications. The pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk manufactures GLP-1s for weight loss, one of which is semaglutide and sold under the brand name Wegovy. (Ozempic is the brand name for a lower-dose version of semaglutide that is prescribed to treat diabetes by increasing insulin but has become so popular in the last year for cosmetic weight loss that it has helped Novo Nordisk’s market value surpass the gross domestic product of Denmark, where the company is headquartered.) GLP-1s are the “new frontier of anti-obesity medications,” says Aaron Kelly, co-director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Pediatric Obesity Medicine. In a 16-month study that appeared in December in The New England Journal of Medicine, co-authored by Kelly, adolescents lost 16 percent of their B.M.I. on semaglutide compared with the placebo group, which gained 0.6 percent. The treatment group also registered improved cholesterol and liver tests. (Both cohorts underwent lifestyle therapy.)

Semaglutide, currently administered through weekly injections at home, suppresses appetite primarily by acting on GLP-1 receptors in the brain. It may also reduce cravings by modifying the brain’s pleasure pathways. Outside the brain, it slows down the transit of food through the gut, so the feeling of fullness lasts longer. “When you put those three things together — the appetite, the satiety and the suppression of cravings — all of a sudden, you get a medication that has pretty profound effects on reducing weight,” Kelly explains. “I think we’re entering a new phase of pediatric obesity medicine, where we’re going to continue to see increasingly effective and durable treatments.""

For several years, Eriyanna Stovall, who just turned 14, has tried unsuccessfully to reduce her meal portions. Her attempts at more healthful eating were also thwarted by the temptation of junk food in the house that her younger siblings, who do not have obesity, love to eat. “I would crave junk food 24/7,” Eriyanna says. She snacked late at night on Doritos and strawberry shortcake in her bedroom. Her mother, who is a nurse, raised the A.A.P. guidelines with their pediatrician, but she doesn’t prescribe weight-loss medications. When I spoke with Eriyanna in May, she had been on Wegovy for a month, after the family found an obesity specialist. “At first, I was really scared because I don’t like shots,” she told me. “But it felt like a little instant pinch.”

For the first two weeks, Eriyanna didn’t notice a change. Then her mother observed that she was full after finishing half her plate, instead of asking for her usual seconds. Fruits and vegetables “are tasty to me now,” Eriyanna says. “I think the medicine did something to my taste buds.”

The major studies of children and these drugs have enrolled many fewer adolescent subjects than adults, but no new safety concerns have emerged. In addition to semaglutide’s principal side effects of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea — reported by two-thirds of study participants — more serious ones include gallstones and pancreatitis. Wegovy comes with a caution about possible thyroid cancer, and the F.D.A. mandates that it include a warning about the possibility of suicidal ideation, because it acts on the brain; further studies are being conducted in Europe. If patients discontinue the medicines, the weight returns. Compared with fen-phen, a popular weight-loss drug in the 1990s that was eventually linked to heart-valve problems, doctors are less concerned about semaglutide, because older drugs in its class have been used to treat diabetes for nearly two decades. But for any new medicine, the long-term risks remain uncertain.        

For now, most adolescents who qualify for semaglutide probably won’t be able to get the drug at all. “I always say it’s an insurance game,” Treah Haggerty, a family-medicine obesity doctor at West Virginia University Medicine, told me. “What hoops can you jump through?” If families pay out of pocket, monthly costs could reach $1,400. “We’re creating haves and have-nots,” Haggerty says. Even with insurance, parents may still encounter drug shortages; Novo Nordisk is already restricting the U.S. supply of starter doses into 2024, effectively limiting new patients. Eriyanna was forced to stop Wegovy when the drug became unavailable to her this summer. She switched to an older, less effective GLP-1, but then that went on back-order too. “We are so devastated,” her mother texted me recently. “It seems like a very big mountain we are climbing.”

For every child given a diagnosis of being overweight or having obesity — even those who choose medication or surgery — the A.A.P. encourages immediately starting intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment, like the one Alexandra undertook. For younger children, this may be the only therapy available to them. Amanda Staiano, a developmental psychologist who helped write the A.A.P. section on lifestyle programs, describes them as “trying to re-engineer the child’s environment and helping with positive parenting strategies.”

This spring, Micheal and Christi Pientowski took their 5-year-old daughter, Emmie, to one such program in Madison, Miss., a state with one of the highest childhood-obesity rates in the country. They were referred by Emmie’s pediatrician because she was gaining weight rapidly; her B.M.I. was pulling upward away from her growth curve on the C.D.C.’s B.M.I. chart.

At their first appointment, Emmie’s parents told the doctor, Whitney Herring, that they were worried about Emmie’s appetite. “She eats, then she’ll immediately be like, ‘Can I have a snack?’ or ‘When are we eating?’” Micheal said.

“If we didn’t stop her, she would keep asking for more and more,” Christi added. “She would get mad at us for having more than she did.”

“We wanted Emmie to see somebody before kindergarten,” Micheal says. “We know how kids are these days. We just don’t want her to be bullied.”

Herring told them not to expect a fast fix. “Even with the body mass index coming down, that is often not a quick process,” she said. If kids see any reduction in B.M.I. from lifestyle treatment, the average is a 1 to 3 percent change in percentile, though other health indicators may improve. Herring asked about Emmie’s meals.

“We’re working on it,” Christi said. “The only vegetable that she will eat is carrots.”

“What about at school?” Herring asked. Christi described a lunch with green beans and peas. The doctor turned to Emmie, who is blond with ruddy cheeks and dimples. “Do you like those at school?”

“No! I never eat those.”        

“Do you ever have broccoli at school?”

“No!”

“We are very picky, too,” Christi said. She avoided most vegetables herself. (Some families have trouble affording vegetables or lack the time to prepare them.)

At school, children like Emmie may not touch their lunch, or they might snack from vending machines. But improving school meals involves more than just substituting asparagus for fries. Judith Siebart, a dietitian who worked with schools nationally, recalls being told, “We can serve all these healthy foods, but if the kids don’t eat it, what have we gained?”

Next, Rebecca Bagwell, the program’s dietitian, wheeled in a cart stacked with silicone foods. She pulled out a seven-inch plate sectioned into different proportions for various foods groups, following MyPlate suggestions. Emmie chose what she liked — chicken, mac and cheese — as Bagwell piled them on the plate in generous portions. “So do you feel like you would want more or less than this?” Bagwell asked.

Emmie looked at the plate. “More?”

Some of Herring’s patients have trouble getting exercise. One boy, who told me the farthest he has walked is down his block, signed up for track team. But the school never started practice. His experience is not uncommon among poorer youth, whose sports participation rates are lower. And while two-thirds of ninth graders attended physical education weekly in 1991, only one-third did so in 2019. Though exercise alone may not result in profound weight loss, it has extraordinary health benefits — and helps our brains regulate appetite.

Herring has expanded her program to cover three different parts of the state, but she still expects as much as 30 percent of her appointments to be no-shows — a problem for many lifestyle treatment programs. From parents missing work to children missing school, families have trouble going to them — if they can find one at all. Herring reckons that the A.A.P.’s recommendation that patients attend at least 26 hours in person over three to 12 months is not feasible for most: “I have yet to find even the most motivated person who’s willing to do two visits a month.”

Many primary-care doctors do not have a program like Herring’s to refer their patients to. “It puts more pressure on me to make sure that I’m not only identifying these kids,” says Sarah Hart, a pediatrician in Kentucky, “but in the short time that I do have with them, how can I really home in and find those areas that we can make a real sustainable change?” It can seem like an impossible ambition to achieve in 15-minute primary-care appointments.

How the medical community approaches patients’ weight — and whether it should even be diagnosing or treating obesity — has led to all sorts of criticism, which has been growing ever since the American Medical Association declared in 2013 that obesity is a disease. While some people felt relief in knowing that they had a medical disorder, many others felt injury in being considered diseased. As weight became a preoccupation in doctors’ offices and the size of people’s bodies became subject to medical treatment — even if they seemed otherwise healthy — patients felt increasingly more stigmatized and concerned that the care they received was biased. Remedies that were meant to help with obesity instead seemed to be hurting the people with the condition.

One of the most vehement responses to the A.A.P. guidelines came from the Collaborative of Eating Disorders Organizations. “This idea of weight loss for higher-weight children — I think all of us were just completely taken aback,” says Johanna Kandel, chief executive of the National Alliance for Eating Disorders, who helped spearhead an open letter from CEDO that responded to the guidelines. Calling them “harmful” and “irresponsible,” the letter’s foremost concern was that screening and treating children for obesity can lead to eating disorders, for which youth at higher weights are already at increased risk. Tracy Richmond, who directs the Boston Children’s eating-disorder program, explains that weight loss in children can trigger eating disorders by making them “hyperfixated on weight and body,” which can then “spiral out of control.” As children continue to restrict their intake, they can become “undernourished relative to where their body would like to be,” a type of anorexia, even if their B.M.I. may not have fallen into the low range. Other eating disorders — bulimia, binge eating — also may emerge.

CEDO’s open letter registered its unequivocal opposition to treating children with obesity with drugs or surgery on the grounds that the long-term effects of these procedures on pediatric patients haven’t been well studied and could also worsen disordered eating. But criticism was also directed at pushing children to make lifestyle changes — what the journalist Virginia Sole-Smith calls “textbook diet culture marketing” in her 2023 book, “Fat Talk” — because these can also eventually lead to eating disorders. (Sole-Smith has written for this magazine.) While research has shown that intensive treatments focusing on health and lifestyle behaviors decrease eating disorders, some experts have pointed out that those studies don’t track children long enough to know if they end up developing disorders; most of this research followed the children for only a year or less. Such concerns raised by CEDO are particularly worrisome, given that the rate of eating disorders doubled in teenage girls during the pandemic.

Focusing on weight in medical settings can also worsen the care children receive. Two-thirds of people with obesity report experiencing bias from doctors. In extreme cases, this can result in devastating consequences, including missed or delayed diagnoses — even death. The health care system may blame parents for their children’s weight and accuse them of overfeeding or not providing enough healthful food. A few states have even moved children with severe obesity into foster care.

The pushback against conceiving weight as medical problem has brought intense scrutiny to the act of measuring obesity. The backlash against B.M.I. — calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared — has been especially forceful. B.M.I. doesn’t take into account whether the weight comes from muscle or fat or where in the body it’s distributed. In June, the A.M.A. began to move away from the measurement when it acknowledged that “B.M.I. cutoffs are based primarily on data collected from previous generations of non-Hispanic white populations and does not consider a person’s gender or ethnicity.” For now, the A.A.P. still endorses B.M.I., in part because alternative measurements can’t readily be performed in most pediatricians’ offices.

Diagnosing people whose B.M.I.s exceed a certain level with obesity — a disease — can increase weight stigma outside medical settings as well. “Our entire concept of ‘fat is bad’ is so rooted in anti-Blackness, white supremacy,” Sole-Smith writes. “When we strive for thinness, we’re reinforcing every other form of stigma at the same time.” People in larger bodies may be perceived as “lazy,” “stupid” or “sloppy” and are constantly vulnerable to insults, slights and jokes. Stigma can also be surprisingly insidious. “If parents say, ‘Fruits and veggies are awesome because it helps us lose weight,’ the weight stigma starts to creep in,” says A. Janet Tomiyama, a psychology professor at U.C.L.A. Experiencing stigma or discrimination because of body size can worsen or even cause health problems.

When it comes to individuals, it’s undeniable that people with obesity can be metabolically healthy, just as normal-weight individuals can be unhealthy. Some studies have even shown that normal-weight individuals may not live as long as those with higher B.M.I.s. Findings like these, along with a greater awareness of the drawbacks that can accompany the medicalizing of obesity, have fueled popular body-positivity movements like Health at Every Size, which seek to disentangle weight from health.

But despite the risks that can accompany obesity treatments — and despite the fact that the data doesn’t always present a clear picture — the prevailing attitude within the medical establishment is that, on balance, the potential negative consequences of obesity are too evident to ignore. When Andrew Stokes, a demographer and public-health professor at Boston University, used people’s weight histories and adequately accounted for important factors like smoking and illnesses, he found that obesity was associated with significantly shorter life spans. Studies can’t prophesy what will happen to any one person, he says, but “this is about probabilities and relative risks.” He adds that obesity is “a cumulative process.” Children with obesity may not be dying of heart attacks, but the Bogalusa Heart Study — one of the longest-running epidemiological studies, it recruited children in the 1970s and followed them through middle age — has nonetheless found that childhood obesity is already associated with cardiovascular and kidney changes that then developed into diseases in adulthood. These findings have been confirmed by autopsies of youth who died in accidents. During the pandemic, obesity was the most common medical condition associated with deaths of people under 21. Lila Monahan, a primary-care pediatrician who uses B.M.I. as a screening tool to help prevent diseases, asks why you would wait until someone started developing abnormalities. She says that’s “like saying someone has high blood pressure, but they’re not having heart attacks, so why are we even measuring their blood pressure?”

Though the A.A.P. guidelines include advice on how to minimize weight bias and avoid stigmatizing patients, and even though they recommend screening children with obesity for eating disorders — and were even vetted by eating-disorder experts, Hampl told me — such safeguards may not be enough. The potential harm that the CEDO letter warns about became a reality a few years ago for a fifth-grader whose middle name is Esther. Her school in New Jersey sent home a letter to be signed, a “B.M.I. report card,” that said her B.M.I. was greater than the 95th percentile for her age. The signature that was required was not her parents’ but her doctor’s. The pediatrician told her mother, Lynn (also a middle name), that the weight gain “was not a big deal” and mentioned an academic medical center’s program that “you guys may want to look into.” The first session taught Esther to assign traffic lights to foods: vegetables, green; candy, red. “They weren’t like, ‘Oh you’re too heavy,’” Lynn says, “It was more like, ‘This is a way to be healthier and change your lifestyle so you can keep this as part of your routine for the rest of your life.’” Esther seemed uncomfortable, though, and cried in the car afterward. “The whole family can do better to eat healthy,” Lynn reassured her.

Esther refused to go back. But that summer, she told her parents she was trying to be “healthier.” She started eating less and walking to school. Then her weight began to drop. The following spring, Esther was diagnosed with anorexia. Over all, she needed four hospitalizations and five months in a residential treatment facility across the country during the pandemic. There, she kicked so hard to resist a feeding tube that she nearly broke Lynn’s ribs. Later, Esther’s heart rate plunged dangerously. “We almost lost her,” Lynn says, her voice cracking. Esther is better now, but her family remains unsettled. The pandemic’s social isolation was central to her daughter’s eating disorder, Lynn says, but the lifestyle program “was probably the catalyst for it.”

“I’m feeling more confident in myself — like, I’m no longer wanting to hide away in a jacket or hoodie,” Alexandra told me in October. Four months after her surgery, she has lost more than 50 pounds and is thrilled to feel good wearing a dress for the first time in a long time, for homecoming. “I’m so proud of her,” Alexandra’s mother says. “She’s doing so great.”

Alexandra’s improved health means she has been able to stop taking her diabetes pills. She will, like all patients who receive bariatric surgery, have to take vitamins for the rest of her life, in part because her altered gastrointestinal tract does not absorb nutrients as well. A decision she made at 16 will continue to affect her entire life.

For someone like Fatima Cody Stanford, a specialist at Harvard who cares for both children and adults with obesity, that’s a positive thing: Redirecting Alexandra’s health in this way is how clinicians should approach childhood obesity. Stanford, who has been using many of the therapies in the A.A.P. guidelines for over a decade, sometimes sees her pediatric patients or their families defer more aggressive treatment, then grow up into adults with obesity, which may pose even greater dangers to their health and be harder to treat — a progression Stanford would like to interrupt when people are still young. “Many people still have this really strong intrinsic belief that if it’s not diet and exercise, then you must have just failed as a human being, particularly in the pediatric population,” she says. As increasingly more effective remedies become available to children like Alexandra, more of them might be set up to lead longer, healthier lives — the reason the A.A.P. put out such comprehensive and urgent guidelines. Yet they are also the same children that others fear will be deeply harmed the most by these very recommendations, and in ways that they may not grasp at such a young age.

Alexandra still exercises most days, but it’s tough to balance a routine with a demanding junior year — two A.P. classes, SAT prep, competing for a summer language program in South Korea. After her operation, dining out with her family has become less enjoyable. She feels full so easily now; even when meals taste delicious and she wants to eat more, she can’t, because she is no longer hungry. Sugar also makes her feel nauseated, so she avoids sweets even though she really wants them sometimes. But, Alexandra says, she was so disheartened before the surgery, putting so much effort into losing weight and feeling like she was “accomplishing nothing.” Now, she says, “it’s refreshing to see the hard work I’m putting in is finally showing results.”"
"F.D.A. Experts Will Vote on Safety of a Cure for Sickle Cell Disease

The Latest
On Tuesday, Oct. 31, an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration will consider a gene editing treatment for sickle cell disease, a potentially deadly, excruciatingly painful, lifelong condition in which blood cells are deformed.

If the panel finds the safety data acceptable and does not think the treatment needs additional study, and the F.D.A.’s commissioner concurs with its assessment, it will be the first medicine to use the revolutionary tool, CRISPR, to snip out a piece of DNA. Other comparable treatments for sickle cell could follow.

“This is a huge deal,” said Dr. John Tisdale, director of the cellular and molecular therapeutics branch at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Why It Matters: A disease with a toll that is difficult to imagine.
An estimated 100,000 people in the United States have sickle cell disease, most of whom have African ancestry. Sickle cell shortens lives, injures organs and bones and causes episodes of searing pain that can repeatedly send patients to emergency rooms, or lead to lengthy hospital stays.

A report by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review said that for people who don’t have sickle cell disease, “it is hard to understand the physical, emotional and mental toll.” People with the disease, the report added, “not only described intense fatigue, anxiety and depression, but at times extreme hopelessness.”

One patient, Mariah Jacqueline Scott, 32, who lives in Highland Park, N.J., has had two hip replacements, two shoulder replacements, a splenectomy, a gall bladder removal and a tonsillectomy because of the disease. She spent the year after her daughter was born in and out of the hospital being treated for extreme pain caused by blocked blood vessels. She had her second shoulder replacement after her shoulder collapsed while she was holding her baby.

The only cure has been a bone-marrow transplant, which requires finding a donor, undergoing intensive chemotherapy and taking immunosuppressive drugs. But gene editing offers an alternative. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics, the makers of the treatment being taken up by the F.D.A. committee on Tuesday, said that in clinical trials, symptoms of the disease went away after patients had the treatment. So far, the patients appear to be cured. The technique activates a gene that can make normally functioning blood cells.

Ms. Scott said she knew gene editing was arduous, but she was seriously considering undergoing the treatment when it became available.

Facts to Keep in Mind: Gene therapies bring their own challenges.
Vertex’s therapy starts when doctors remove stem cells from the blood and send them for treatment. Next comes intense chemotherapy to completely clear the bone marrow before the treated cells are injected. After that, patients must spend at least a month in a hospital while the treated cells repopulate the bone marrow.

Because each patient’s cells must be treated individually there are questions about how quickly companies can ramp up production.

“Manufacturing is very complicated,” said Dr. Stephan Grupp, chief of the cellular therapy and transplant section of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who consults for Vertex.

Treatment will be extremely expensive, potentially in the millions of dollars per patient, and the companies will not say how many patients they expect to be able to treat at first.

Gene editing can also impose personal hardship on patients and their families. A hospital with the expertise to administer the treatment and care for patients may be far from home. And patients must stay there for a long period of time.

What’s next: More F.D.A. decisions and more drugs.
If the advisory committee recommends the Vertex treatment, the F.D.A. will decide whether to approve it on Dec. 8.

On Dec. 20, the F.D.A. will decide on another application for sickle cell gene therapy made by Bluebird Bio. Two other companies and an academic center, Boston Children’s Hospital, are testing their own sickle cell gene therapies.

While these therapies could reduce the suffering of sickle cell patients in the United States and other wealthy countries, there is an even greater need for them in some developing countries like Nigeria. However, they will be difficult to export to developing countries because the treatments are extremely expensive and they can only be administered at hospitals where doctors have expertise in a number of advanced techniques.

One company, Beam, is testing a way to provide gene editing that requires nothing more than a single infusion in a doctor’s office. Vertex has what it calls an “aspirational” method that would deliver gene editing in a pill."
"Hearing Aids Are More Affordable, and Perhaps More Needed, Than Ever
Over-the-counter devices have been available for a year now. New research suggests they may have unexpected benefits.

A year ago, the Food and Drug Administration announced new regulations allowing the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids and setting standards for their safety and effectiveness.

That step — which was supposed to take three years but required five — portended cheaper, high-quality hearing aids that people with mild to moderate hearing loss could buy online or at local pharmacies and big stores.

So how’s it going? It’s a mixed picture.

Manufacturers and retailers have become serious about making hearing aids more accessible and affordable. Yet the O.T.C. market remains confusing, if not downright chaotic, for the mostly older consumers the new regulations were intended to help.

The past year also brought renewed focus on the importance of treating hearing loss, which affects two-thirds of people over age 70. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University published the first randomized clinical trial showing that hearing aids could help reduce the pace of cognitive decline.

Some background: In 2020, the influential Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care identified hearing loss as the greatest potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia.

Previous studies had demonstrated a link between hearing loss and cognitive decline, said Dr. Frank Lin, an otolaryngologist and epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins and lead author of the new research.

“What remained unanswered was, If we treat hearing loss, does it actually reduce cognitive loss?” he said. The ACHIEVE study (for Aging and Cognitive Health Evaluation in Elders) showed that, at least for a particular group of older adults, it could.

Of nearly 1,000 people ages 70 to 84 with untreated mild to moderate hearing loss, half received hearing assessments from audiologists, were fitted with midpriced hearing aids and were counseled on how to use them for several months. The control group participated in a health education program.

Over three years, the study found that hearing-aid use had scant effect on healthy volunteers at low risk of cognitive loss. But among participants who were older and less affluent, hearing aids reduced the rate of cognitive decline by 48 percent, compared with the control group, a difference the researchers deemed “clinically meaningful.”

This subset of participants had lower income and “were older, less educated, with higher rates of diabetes and hypertension,” Dr. Lin said. Because such factors are also associated with dementia, “the people at higher risk really stand to benefit the most,” he said.

In trying to slow cognitive decline, “with a lot of other therapies and treatments, we learn that they can be too little, too late,” he added. ACHIEVE indicates that “they can still see the benefits later in life.” Another three years of follow-up should reveal any further effects of hearing-aid use on both groups.

The researchers also plan to publish findings on how hearing-aid use affects brain atrophy, social isolation, depression and quality of life.

Some experts object to emphasizing a connection between dementia and hearing loss, “as though it plants a dementia seed and the hearing aid keeps it from germinating,” said Dr. Jan Blustein, a medical researcher at the N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine.

Because of the stigma of dementia, “people who would potentially get treatment for hearing loss may be less likely to,” Dr. Blustein said.

She added that enabling greater social interaction, with its known beneficial effects on cognition and mental health, is reason enough to promote hearing-aid use. Researchers at the University of Colorado also recently reported that consistent hearing-aid use by older adults was associated with a lower risk of falls.

But acquiring quality hearing aids over the counter, as opposed to more expensive prescription devices through an audiology practice, can still feel challenging.

The F.D.A. reviews “self-fitting” hearing aids, the kind users can customize with a smartphone app; it has found eight brands in compliance with regulations since 2022. A small study recently published in JAMA Otolaryngology found that patients who were given a commercially available, self-fitting hearing aid in a clinical trial could, after six weeks, hear as well as patients fitted with the same device by audiologists.

But not everyone with hearing loss feels comfortable with online sales and do-it-yourself adjustments via apps. And devices that aren’t self-fitting, and instead use preset controls, don’t undergo F.D.A. review at all.

“It’s still Day 1 of the market’s opening,” said Barbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America, an advocacy and support group. “The price points are all over. There’s still confusion among consumers.”

Adding to that uncertainty, some marketers have resorted to misleading advertising — some claim that their devices restore natural hearing, for instance. No hearing aid can do that.

“There are bad actors,” said Kate Carr, president of the Hearing Industries Association, which represents major manufacturers. “One company was advertising ‘C.I.A. technology.’” In response, the F.D.A. published a guide for consumers this year.

Still, progress. Self-fitting O.T.C. aids that perform well are now widely available for about $1,000 a pair; prescription hearing aids purchased through audiologists cost several times more.

Perhaps because older Americans don’t know about or mistrust the new over-the-counter devices, or because they still find the price a barrier, initial sales appear modest. (Traditional Medicare doesn’t cover hearing aids; Medicare Advantage plans offering hearing benefits still leave patients paying most of the costs.)

Lexie Hearing, a major manufacturer, sells self-fitting O.T.C. devices for $799 to $999 a pair online and in 14,000 stores nationwide. According to Seline van der Wat, the chief operating officer, the company is on track to sell 90,000 pairs this year.

But Lexie, whose hearing aids are designed and engineered by Bose, is encouraged by its findings that 94 percent of those buyers are first-time purchasers.

“We’re finally able to access a part of the market that was previously unpenetrated because of the costs,” she said. The company projects sales of 260,000 pairs next year and a million per year in 2027.

Other device makers and distributors are ramping up, too. Best Buy announced that 200 more of its stores began carrying O.T.C. hearing aids this summer, and that number will reach 600 this fall. The global vision company EssilorLuxottica plans to introduce hearing aids embedded in eyeglass earpieces late next year.

Several traditional manufacturers have also begun selling over-the-counter devices, sometimes teaming up with better-known consumer companies to promote brand recognition: WS Audiology with Sony, Sonova with Sennheiser. Some experts expect Apple, Sanyo or other consumer-electronics giants to enter the field.

To help guide buyers, HearAdvisor — a company founded by two audiologists and a hearing scientist — has built an independent acoustic lab in Rockford, Ill., to evaluate and rank both prescription and O.T.C. hearing aids for those with mild to moderate loss.

“We’re trying to be the Good Housekeeping seal of approval for hearing aids,” Andy Sabin, a co-founder, said.

After testing about 50 devices to date, HearAdvisor gave its “Expert Choice” award to 13. In general, O.T.C. devices that cost $1,000 or more perform well, Dr. Sabin said, while those sold online today for under $500 “are most often junk.” A few may actually reduce intelligibility.

Wirecutter, a division of The New York Times, has also evaluated hearing aids, and the Hearing Loss Association has planned a series of webinars called OTC 101. The first, on Nov. 1, will feature F.D.A. regulators.

The United States is the first country to develop a regulated O.T.C. hearing aid market, and “the tech companies and the retailers are still experimenting,” Dr. Lin pointed out. He predicts increased innovation and lower prices ahead.

At the moment, though, he said, “it’s still very much a work in progress.”"
"Doctors Wrestle With A.I. in Patient Care, Citing Lax Oversight
The F.D.A. has approved many new programs that use artificial intelligence, but doctors are skeptical that the tools really improve care or are backed by solid research.

In medicine, the cautionary tales about the unintended effects of artificial intelligence are already legendary.

There was the program meant to predict when patients would develop sepsis, a deadly bloodstream infection, that triggered a litany of false alarms. Another, intended to improve follow-up care for the sickest patients, appeared to deepen troubling health disparities.

Wary of such flaws, physicians have kept A.I. working on the sidelines: assisting as a scribe, as a casual second opinion and as a back-office organizer. But the field has gained investment and momentum for uses in medicine and beyond.

Within the Food and Drug Administration, which plays a key role in approving new medical products, A.I. is a hot topic. It is helping to discover new drugs. It could pinpoint unexpected side effects. And it is even being discussed as an aid to staff who are overwhelmed with repetitive, rote tasks.

Yet in one crucial way, the F.D.A.’s role has been subject to sharp criticism: how carefully it vets and describes the programs it approves to help doctors detect everything from tumors to blood clots to collapsed lungs.

“We’re going to have a lot of choices. It’s exciting,” Dr. Jesse Ehrenfeld, president of the American Medical Association, a leading doctors’ lobbying group, said in an interview. “But if physicians are going to incorporate these things into their workflow, if they’re going to pay for them and if they’re going to use them — we’re going to have to have some confidence that these tools work.”

President Biden issued an executive order on Monday that calls for regulations across a broad spectrum of agencies to try to manage the security and privacy risks of A.I., including in health care. The order seeks more funding for A.I. research in medicine and also for a safety program to gather reports on harm or unsafe practices. There is a meeting with world leaders later this week to discuss the topic.

In an event Monday, Mr. Biden said it was important to oversee A.I. development and safety and build systems that people can trust.

“For example, to protect patients, we will use A.I. to develop cancer drugs that work better and cost less,” Mr. Biden said. “We will also launch a safety program to make sure A.I. health systems do no harm.”

No single U.S. agency governs the entire landscape. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, summoned tech executives to Capitol Hill in September to discuss ways to nurture the field and also identify pitfalls.

Google has already drawn attention from Congress with its pilot of a new chatbot for health workers. Called Med-PaLM 2, it is designed to answer medical questions, but has raised concerns about patient privacy and informed consent.

How the F.D.A. will oversee such “large language models,” or programs that mimic expert advisers, is just one area where the agency lags behind rapidly evolving advances in the A.I. field. Agency officials have only begun to talk about reviewing technology that would continue to “learn” as it processes thousands of diagnostic scans. And the agency’s existing rules encourage developers to focus on one problem at a time — like a heart murmur or a brain aneurysm — a contrast to A.I. tools used in Europe that scan for a range of problems.

The agency’s reach is limited to products being approved for sale. It has no authority over programs that health systems build and use internally. Large health systems like Stanford, Mayo Clinic and Duke — as well as health insurers — can build their own A.I. tools that affect care and coverage decisions for thousands of patients with little to no direct government oversight.

Still, doctors are raising more questions as they attempt to deploy the roughly 350 software tools that the F.D.A. has cleared to help detect clots, tumors or a hole in the lung. They have found few answers to basic questions: How was the program built? How many people was it tested on? Is it likely to identify something a typical doctor would miss?

The lack of publicly available information, perhaps paradoxical in a realm replete with data, is causing doctors to hang back, wary that technology that sounds exciting can lead patients down a path to more biopsies, higher medical bills and toxic drugs without significantly improving care.

Dr. Eric Topol, author of a book on A.I. in medicine, is a nearly unflappable optimist about the technology’s potential. But he said the F.D.A. had fumbled by allowing A.I. developers to keep their “secret sauce” under wraps and failing to require careful studies to assess any meaningful benefits.

“You have to have really compelling, great data to change medical practice and to exude confidence that this is the way to go,” said Dr. Topol, executive vice president of Scripps Research in San Diego. Instead, he added, the F.D.A. has allowed “shortcuts.”

Large studies are beginning to tell more of the story: One found the benefits of using A.I. to detect breast cancer and another highlighted flaws in an app meant to identify skin cancer, Dr. Topol said.

Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, the chief of the F.D.A.’s medical device division, has acknowledged the need for continuing efforts to ensure that A.I. programs deliver on their promises after his division clears them. While drugs and some devices are tested on patients before approval, the same is not typically required of A.I. software programs.

One new approach could be building labs where developers could access vast amounts of data and build or test A.I. programs, Dr. Shuren said during the National Organization for Rare Disorders conference on Oct. 16.

“If we really want to assure that right balance, we’re going to have to change federal law, because the framework in place for us to use for these technologies is almost 50 years old,” Dr. Shuren said. “It really was not designed for A.I.”

Other forces complicate efforts to adapt machine learning for major hospital and health networks. Software systems don’t talk to each other. No one agrees on who should pay for them.

By one estimate, about 30 percent of radiologists (a field in which A.I. has made deep inroads) are using A.I. technology. Simple tools that might sharpen an image are an easy sell. But higher-risk ones, like those selecting whose brain scans should be given priority, concern doctors if they do not know, for instance, whether the program was trained to catch the maladies of a 19-year-old versus a 90-year-old.

Aware of such flaws, Dr. Nina Kottler is leading a multiyear, multimillion-dollar effort to vet A.I. programs. She is the chief medical officer for clinical A.I. at Radiology Partners, a Los Angeles-based practice that reads roughly 50 million scans annually for about 3,200 hospitals, free-standing emergency rooms and imaging centers in the United States.

She knew diving into A.I. would be delicate with the practice’s 3,600 radiologists. After all, Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “godfather of A.I.,” roiled the profession in 2016 when he predicted that machine learning would replace radiologists altogether.

Dr. Kottler said she began evaluating approved A.I. programs by quizzing their developers and then tested some to see which programs missed relatively obvious problems or pinpointed subtle ones.

She rejected one approved program that did not detect lung abnormalities beyond the cases her radiologists found — and missed some obvious ones.

Another program that scanned images of the head for aneurysms, a potentially life-threatening condition, proved impressive, she said. Though it flagged many false positives, it detected about 24 percent more cases than radiologists had identified. More people with an apparent brain aneurysm received follow-up care, including a 47-year-old with a bulging vessel in an unexpected corner of the brain.

At the end of a telehealth appointment in August, Dr. Roy Fagan realized he was having trouble speaking to the patient. Suspecting a stroke, he hurried to a hospital in rural North Carolina for a CT scan.

The image went to Greensboro Radiology, a Radiology Partners practice, where it set off an alert in a stroke-triage A.I. program. A radiologist didn’t have to sift through cases ahead of Dr. Fagan’s or click through more than 1,000 image slices; the one spotting the brain clot popped up immediately.

The radiologist had Dr. Fagan transferred to a larger hospital that could rapidly remove the clot. He woke up feeling normal.

“It doesn’t always work this well,” said Dr. Sriyesh Krishnan, of Greensboro Radiology, who is also director of innovation development at Radiology Partners. “But when it works this well, it’s life changing for these patients.”

Dr. Fagan wanted to return to work the following Monday, but agreed to rest for a week. Impressed with the A.I. program, he said, “It’s a real advancement to have it here now.”

Radiology Partners has not published its findings in medical journals. Some researchers who have, though, highlighted less inspiring instances of the effects of A.I. in medicine.

University of Michigan researchers examined a widely used A.I. tool in an electronic health-record system meant to predict which patients would develop sepsis. They found that the program fired off alerts on one in five patients — though only 12 percent went on to develop sepsis.

Another program that analyzed health costs as a proxy to predict medical needs ended up depriving treatment to Black patients who were just as sick as white ones. The cost data turned out to be a bad stand-in for illness, a study in the journal Science found, since less money is typically spent on Black patients.

Those programs were not vetted by the F.D.A. But given the uncertainties, doctors have turned to agency approval records for reassurance. They found little. One research team looking at A.I. programs for critically ill patients found evidence of real-world use “completely absent” or based on computer models. The University of Pennsylvania and University of Southern California team also discovered that some of the programs were approved based on their similarities to existing medical devices — including some that did not even use artificial intelligence.

Another study of F.D.A.-cleared programs through 2021 found that of 118 A.I. tools, only one described the geographic and racial breakdown of the patients the program was trained on. The majority of the programs were tested on 500 or fewer cases — not enough, the study concluded, to justify deploying them widely.

Dr. Keith Dreyer, a study author and chief data science officer at Mass General Brigham, is now leading a project through the American College of Radiology to fill the gap of information. With the help of A.I. vendors that have been willing to share information, he and colleagues plan to publish an update on the agency-cleared programs.

That way, for instance, doctors can look up how many pediatric cases a program was built to recognize to inform them of blind spots that could potentially affect care.

James McKinney, an F.D.A. spokesman, said the agency’s staff members review thousands of pages before clearing A.I. programs, but acknowledged that software makers may write the publicly released summaries. Those are not “intended for the purpose of making purchasing decisions,” he said, adding that more detailed information is provided on product labels, which are not readily accessible to the public.

Getting A.I. oversight right in medicine, a task that involves several agencies, is critical, said Dr. Ehrenfeld, the A.M.A. president. He said doctors have scrutinized the role of A.I. in deadly plane crashes to warn about the perils of automated safety systems overriding a pilot’s — or a doctor’s — judgment.

He said the 737 Max plane crash inquiries had shown how pilots weren’t trained to override a safety system that contributed to the deadly collisions. He is concerned that doctors might encounter a similar use of A.I. running in the background of patient care that could prove harmful.

“Just understanding that the A.I. is there should be an obvious place to start,” Dr. Ehrenfeld said. “But it’s not clear that that will always happen if we don’t have the right regulatory framework.”"
"How a Lucrative Surgery Took Off Online and Disfigured Patients
More surgeons are opting for a complicated hernia repair that they learned from videos on social media showing shoddy techniques.

The bulge on the side of Peggy Hudson’s belly was the size of a cantaloupe. And it was growing.

“I was afraid it would burst,” said Ms. Hudson, 74, a retired airport baggage screener in Ocala, Fla.

The painful protrusion was the result of a surgery gone wrong, according to medical records from two doctors she later saw. Using a four-armed robot, a surgeon in 2021 had tried to repair a small hole in the wall of her abdomen, known as a hernia. Rather than closing the hole, the procedure left Ms. Hudson with what is called a “Mickey Mouse hernia,” in which intestines spill out on both sides of the torso like the cartoon character’s ears.

One of the doctors she saw later, a leading hernia expert at the Cleveland Clinic, doubted that Ms. Hudson had even needed the surgery. The operation, known as a component separation, is recommended only for large or complex hernias that are tough to close. Ms. Hudson’s original tear, which was about two inches, could have been patched with stitches and mesh, the surgeon believed.

Component separation is a technically difficult and risky procedure. Yet more and more surgeons have embraced it since 2006, when the approach — which had long been used in plastic surgery — was adapted for hernias. Over the next 15 years, the number of times that doctors billed Medicare for a hernia component separation increased more than tenfold, to around 8,000 per year. And that figure is a fraction of the actual number, researchers said, because most hernia patients are too young to be covered by Medicare.

In skilled hands, component separations can successfully close large hernias and alleviate pain. But many surgeons, including some who taught themselves the operation by watching videos on social media, are endangering patients by trying these operations when they aren’t warranted, a New York Times investigation found.

Dr. Michael Rosen, the Cleveland Clinic surgeon who later repaired Ms. Hudson’s hernias, helped develop and popularize the component separation technique, traveling the country to teach other doctors. He now counts that work among his biggest regrets because it encouraged surgeons to try the procedure when it wasn’t appropriate. Half of his operations these days, he said, are attempts to fix those doctors’ mistakes.

“It’s unbelievable,” Dr. Rosen said. “I’m watching reasonably healthy people with a routine problem get a complicated procedure that turns it into a devastating problem.”

Ms. Hudson’s original surgeon, Dr. Edwin Menor, said he learned to perform robotic component separation a few years ago. He said he initially found the procedure challenging and that some of his operations had been “not perfect.”

Dr. Menor said that he now performs component separations a few times a week and that, with additional experience, “you improve eventually.” He said he had a roughly 95 percent success rate. In Ms. Hudson’s case, he said, the use of component separation was warranted based on the complexity of her hernia and her history of prior abdominal surgeries.

Component separation must be practiced dozens of times to master, experts said. But one out of four surgeons said they taught themselves how to perform the operation by watching Facebook and YouTube videos, according to a recent survey — part of a broader pattern of surgeons of all stripes learning new techniques on social media with minimal professional oversight.

Other hernia surgeons, including Dr. Menor, learned component separation at events sponsored by medical device companies. Intuitive, for example, makes a $1.4 million robot known as the da Vinci that is sometimes used for component separations. Intuitive has paid for hundreds of hernia surgeons to attend short courses to learn how to use the machine for the procedure. The company makes money not only from selling the machines but also by charging some hospitals every time they use the robot.

Many surgeons — even some paid by device companies to teach the technique — haven’t learned how to properly carry out component separation with the da Vinci, The Times found. In fact, at times they are teaching one another the wrong techniques.

The robot comes with a built-in camera that makes it easy for doctors to record high-resolution videos of their surgeries. The videos are often shared online, including in a Facebook group of about 13,000 hernia surgeons. Some videos capture surgeons using shoddy practices and making appalling mistakes, surgeons said.

One instructional video, paid for by another major medical device company, showed a surgeon slicing through the wrong part of the muscle with the da Vinci. Experts said the result could have been devastating, turning the abdominal muscles into what one described as “dead meat.”

Peper Long, a spokeswoman for Intuitive, said the company hired “experienced surgeons” to lead its training courses. “The rise in robotic-assisted hernia procedures reflects the clinical benefits that the technology can offer,” she said.

In interviews with The Times, more than a dozen hernia surgeons pointed to another reason for the surging use of component separations: They earn doctors and hospitals more money. Medicare pays at least $2,450 for a component separation, compared with $345 for a simpler hernia repair. Private insurers, which cover a significant portion of hernia surgeries, typically pay two or three times what Medicare does.

Repeat Billings
Fixing the torn muscles of a hernia is like closing a suitcase: It’s usually not too difficult to bring the two sides together and zip it up. But a large hernia, like an overstuffed bag, doesn’t have enough slack to bring the muscles back together.

Around 2006, surgeons adapted a technique from plastic surgery, called component separation, to close large hernias. On each side of the torso, they carefully cut the muscle to create slack, resulting in something like an extra zipper in expandable luggage.

Component Separation
A surgical technique called a component separation can repair large or complex hernias.

Other hernia surgeons were initially afraid to try it. They would have to make incisions that ran from the sternum down to the pelvic bone and would have to distinguish between three parallel planes of muscle, each just millimeters wide. And while making tiny cuts, they would have to carefully avoid bundles of nerves and blood vessels. Cut a bundle, and the muscle becomes useless.

Despite its difficulty, the procedure took off — and with it, the opportunity for doctors to make more money.

The federal government assigns a value to everything a doctor does, from an annual physical to a complex surgery, in order to determine how much Medicare should pay. These values — known as relative value units, or R.V.U.s — are also used by private health plans, and therefore dictate most doctors’ earnings. Many hospitals require their doctors to ring up a minimum number of R.V.U.s. Some doctors get bonuses if they exceed that goal or have their salaries docked if they fall short.

Component separation has a high value. A traditional hernia repair earns between 6 and 22 R.V.U.s for the surgeon, which for Medicare patients translates to $200 to $750. Tacking on a component separation for both sides of the torso brings in an additional 34.5 R.V.U.s., or about $1,200 more for the surgeon. (Medicare also pays the hospital for each procedure.)

When the R.V.U. system began, in 1992, component separation was part of a billing category that consisted of plastic surgery procedures such as reconstructing a patient’s torso after a traumatic accident. Because the procedure demanded a high level of skill and took so much effort, it was given a high R.V.U.

But since 2006, its use for hernias has soared, Medicare data shows.

Component Separations Have Soared for Hernia Patients on Medicare
Billings for the procedure increased sharply.

Part of the rise reflects the fact that some people with small hernias, who don’t need complicated surgery, are nonetheless getting component separations. A study by Dr. Dana Telem, a hernia surgeon at the University of Michigan, found that was happening in about one-third of cases.

Another factor is that some surgeons have been billing insurers up to four times for a single procedure. In 2017, the American College of Surgeons warned them to stop, saying they could bill twice, at most — once for each side of the torso.

Robots on Facebook
As hernia surgeons were dabbling in component separation, a larger shift in surgery was underway: using robots to operate.

Intuitive debuted its da Vinci robot in 2000, with the idea that more precise surgery would shorten recovery times. Surgeons could remotely control the robot’s tiny clamps and scissors, allowing them to carry out complex operations with small incisions.

The company marketed the robot to a variety of specialties, including cardiology and urology. It found notable success in gynecology but faltered in 2013, when an influential study reported that robotic surgery for hysterectomies was no better than a more standard technique.

Around that time, Intuitive made a big push with general surgeons, offering training events around the country where doctors could test out the da Vinci for surgeries like gallbladder removals and simple hernia repairs, one of the most common surgeries in the country.

By 2017, Intuitive brought in more than $3 billion in revenues on the da Vinci, and was trumpeting the largely untapped potential of the hernia market. “We believe hernia repair procedures represent a significant opportunity with the potential to drive growth in future periods,” the company said in its 2017 annual report.

The marketing was “masterful,” said Dr. Guy Voeller, a hernia surgeon in Tennessee and former president of the American Hernia Society. “They made it explode.”

Beyond traditional sales tactics, Intuitive also made inroads into the growing Facebook group, a lively forum where hernia surgeons discussed everything from troubleshooting tricky cases to complaining about their pay.

At first, the group’s members weren’t keen on the robot, questioning whether the flashy new tool was worth its steep price tag. “A lot of added expense with what perceived benefit to the patient?” one surgeon wrote on the Facebook group’s page in 2014.

Around that time, an Intuitive representative placed a phone call to Dr. Eugene Dickens, a general surgeon at a community hospital in Tulsa, Okla.

Dr. Dickens had grown up playing video games and was immediately comfortable at the da Vinci’s remote controls, which he used for dozens of gallbladder, appendix and simple hernia surgeries. Intuitive was paying him to be a consultant. (Since 2013 he has received about $1 million.)

Now the company wanted him to jump into the Facebook fray and win over the naysayers, he said.

“We are getting decimated by this little hernia group,” Dr. Dickens recalled the company representative saying. “Can you join and help defend us?”

He and other robot enthusiasts began to sing the da Vinci’s praises in the Facebook group, he said. (He said that Intuitive did not pay him for his Facebook posts.)

Over time, the group warmed to the robot, not just for simple hernia repairs but also for more complex operations like component separations. Surgeons began posting videos showing off the new procedure, drawing dozens of positive comments.

Surgeons used the da Vinci for more than 1.3 million hernia repairs between 2016 and 2022, Ms. Long said, or about 15 percent of the total procedures by the company’s robots. Only about 13,000 of those hernia repairs were component separations, she said.

Intrigued by the hype, Dr. Dickens taught himself component separation by watching online videos. His first operation went well, he recalled, but a later patient developed a serious complication, necessitating an additional surgery.

Then, at a dinner meeting in Houston, he presented a video of one of his own surgeries to a group of about 50 other doctors, Dr. Dickens recalled. A more experienced surgeon interrupted to say he was operating on the wrong part of the muscle. The embarrassing rebuke felt like a “red flag,” he said, and he stopped doing the procedure, although he is still a proponent of the da Vinci for other operations.

An academic study in 2020 found that “unsafe recommendations often go uncontested” in the Facebook group and warned that “surgeons should be cautious” about using the page for clinical advice.

Dr. Brian Jacob, the hernia surgeon who founded the Facebook group, said that after the study was published, he made an effort to not let bad advice go unchallenged. He said that surgeons have described performing component separations on small hernias. When he sees those posts, he said, he typically comments to say, “That’s not how I would have done it.”

Trashing the Abdominal Wall
In June of 2021, W.L. Gore & Associates, a medical device company that makes surgical mesh used in hernia repairs, posted a video tutorial on its website. It promised to be a step-by-step guide to component separation surgery.

A surgeon narrated as he cut the patient’s abdominal muscles, releasing tissue so he could close a hernia. But he was operating in the wrong place and likely created a new hernia, according to four surgeons who reviewed the video.

“It absolutely trashed the abdominal wall,” said Jeffrey Blatnik, who directs the Washington University Hernia Center. “It was so offensive to the point that we reached out to the company and told them, ‘You guys need to take this down.’”

Component Separation on Video
Screenshots from two hernia repair videos, one properly done and one risking further injury, according to four hernia surgeons.

Jessica Moran, a spokeswoman for W.L. Gore, said that after surgeons flagged the error, the company removed the video; it had been online for 10 months. “We have investigated what happened here to avoid this happening again in the future,” Ms. Moran said.

Dr. Rodolfo Oviedo performed the faulty surgery. Ms. Moran said the company had paid him $4,400 for it.

Dr. Oviedo acknowledged that he had made mistakes but said he had improved. “At some point I was doing it wrong, and nobody’s perfect,” he said in an interview in June, when he was the director of robotic education at Houston Methodist, a major hospital in Texas. He said it was only at some point after the surgery that he learned of his potentially serious errors.

Four months later, Dr. Oviedo offered a new explanation. He said that he had learned of his mistake in real time and had repaired the damage while the patient was still on the operating table. He said the patient, with whom he followed up for 18 months, had not experienced complications. (Dr. Oviedo left Houston Methodist for another job in July.)

W.L. Gore’s video had plenty of company: A study of 50 highly viewed hernia repair videos on YouTube found that 84 percent did not follow all safety guidelines.

In addition to relying on online videos, surgeons also learn new techniques at training sessions paid for by device companies, which typically cover travel and a one- or two-day course. But the companies do little vetting of their instructors, experts said.

Earlier this year, Dr. Blatnik fixed a bad component separation surgery where the original surgeon had cut into the wrong muscle plane. The patient’s intestines were bulging out of her sides, another Mickey Mouse hernia.

Dr. Blatnik said he immediately recognized the name of the surgeon who had operated on the patient because that he had seen that surgeon teach component separation at a course sponsored by a device company. The surgeon has received more than $130,000 in payments over the past decade from companies including Intuitive and Bard, which manufacturers hernia mesh, The Times found.

Looking Pregnant

Academic research is only now starting to quantify the complication rate of component separations for hernias.

In 2019, researchers analyzed five studies of patients who underwent the procedure and found that only 4 percent developed another hernia. But a newer study from the Cleveland Clinic, which followed patients for two years to see if a new bulge had developed, found the number was 26 percent.

Seven years ago, Sandy Aken said, she had a hernia the size of her fist. A surgeon in Huntington Beach, Calif., performed a component separation. Three months later, her belly was still protruding, and she felt like her guts were spilling out. She saw another doctor for help.

“This patient has a significantly compromised abdominal wall with damaged muscle due to the history of component separation,” that doctor wrote in a summary of the visit. Another hernia surgeon told her he could not fix the bulge, she said.

Ms. Aken, 64, now looks nine months pregnant. She cannot bend over without pain, a limitation that forced her to leave her job as a caregiver.

In 2018, Dr. Willie Melvin performed a component separation with the da Vinci on Jennifer Gulledge, whose large hernia made her a good candidate for the operation. But he cut into the wrong part of the muscle, leaving new holes on each side of her body and too little slack to close her original hernia, another surgeon concluded after reviewing her case.

Less than a week later, he performed an emergency surgery to close the original hernia. But the side tears remained.

Dr. Melvin declined to discuss Ms. Gulledge’s case. He said he had a lot of experience with complex hernia cases that other surgeons have referred to him and that he and his partner performed about three component separation surgeries a month. Intuitive paid him more than $25,000 last year to demonstrate his technique to other surgeons and to check the work of doctors who are new to robotic surgery.

In February 2020, Dr. Ajita Prabhu, a Cleveland Clinic hernia surgeon who has studied the frequency of failed component separation, operated on Ms. Gulledge. Dr. Prabhu told her patient that she would try her best, but that the damage from the original surgery was probably irreparable.

She was right. Even with her abdominal muscles sewed back together, Ms. Gulledge lived with intense pain. Routine tasks were difficult: When she changed her granddaughter’s diaper, she had to remind the 2-year-old not to kick “grandma’s bad belly.”

In August, Ms. Gulledge drove 700 miles to Cleveland for a follow-up appointment. She spent four days on the road, sometimes stopping every 30 minutes because it hurt too much to remain behind the wheel.

When Dr. Prabhu examined her, she confirmed Ms. Gulledge’s fear: Another hernia had opened up.

"Eyedrops From Major Brands May Cause Infection, F.D.A. Says
Target, CVS and Rite Aid are pulling products from shelves after federal investigators found unsanitary conditions and recommended a recall.

Federal health officials are advising consumers to stop using more than two dozen over-the-counter eyedrops products because of a potential risk of eye infection that may lead to partial vision loss or blindness.

The Food and Drug Administration issued an alert on Friday flagging 26 eye care products including eyedrops and gels from CVS Health, Leader (Cardinal Health), Rugby (Cardinal Health), Rite Aid, Target up&up and Velocity Pharma.

Read the full list of recalled products here.

The federal agency recommended on Wednesday that the manufacturer recall all lots of those products after agency investigators found unsanitary conditions in a manufacturing plant, according to the news release from the F.D.A. Bacterial tests came back positive from critical drug production areas in the plant, which the agency did not immediately identify.

The F.D.A. said that it had not received any reports of infection associated with these products, but it was encouraging health care professionals and patients to report any cases to the agency.

It’s imperative that these products are sterile, regulators said, because drugs applied to the eyes bypass some of the body’s natural defenses.

The F.D.A. said consumers should properly discard these products by taking them to a drug take-back site or by checking whether a product was included on the F.D.A.’s “flush list” of drugs that can be safely discarded at home.

CVS, Rite Aid and Target are removing the products from their stores and websites, the agency said. Products branded as Leader, Rugby and Velocity may still be available in stores and online and should not be purchased, federal regulators said.

Rite Aid confirmed through a spokeswoman that it was removing “applicable Rite Aid branded products” from store shelves. A CVS spokeswoman said that the retail chain “immediately stopped the sale in-store and online of all products supplied by Velocity Pharma within the CVS Health Brand Eye Products portfolio,” and that customers could return those products for a full refund. The other retailers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

There have been other recent reports of problems with eye products.

In January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the F.D.A. warned consumers to stop using EzriCare Artificial Tears and Delsam Pharma’s Artificial Tears. The eyedrops were linked to a drug-resistant strain of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was linked to at least four deaths and vision loss in 14 patients.

Apotex, a Canadian pharmaceutical company, recalled prescription eyedrops in March after some bottle caps developed cracks, which could compromise the product’s sterility.

Experts say that eyedrops are generally safe to use. By 2024, 123 million Americans are projected to use eyedrops, according to Statista, a market research firm."
"CUNY Halts Investigation of Alzheimer’s Researcher
Citing questions about the integrity of the process, the university said that “no final action” had been taken.

The City University of New York is pausing its investigation into a faculty member, an Alzheimer’s researcher accused of misconduct, the university said in a statement on Friday.

Studies by the neuroscientist, Hoau-Yan Wang, underpin an Alzheimer’s drug in advanced clinical trials. The drug, simufilam, is made by Cassava Sciences, a pharmaceutical company based in Texas. Dr. Wang frequently collaborated with Lindsay H. Burns, the company’s chief scientist.

“Because questions regarding the confidentiality and integrity of this investigation have been raised, CUNY will stay the underlying inquiry into the allegations regarding Dr. Wang’s research until such time as the University completes a comprehensive investigation of the process,” the university said.

Dr. Wang did not respond to a request for comment.

“Since September 2021, Cassava Sciences has been waiting for a reliable and credible investigation from CUNY,” Remi Barbier, Cassava’s founder and chief executive, said in an email. “We’re still waiting.”

From the start, some scientists were skeptical of simufilam’s purported mode of action and later of Cassava’s reports of improvements among its clinical trial participants. Following accusations in 2021 that Dr. Wang and Cassava may have manipulated data, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Institutes of Health began investigating the research.

A committee convened by CUNY also began an investigation into Dr. Wang’s work and his lab’s finances over two decades.

On Oct. 12, the journal Science made public a draft of the committee’s report, which concluded that Dr. Wang was “reckless” in his failure to keep or provide original data, an offense that “amounts to significant research misconduct.” (The investigators also concluded that Dr. Burns was responsible for errors in some of the papers.)

CUNY declined to comment on the document at the time but said it would formally release the report this month. Since then, critics have questioned the objectivity of the investigators and the veracity of their descriptions of Dr. Wang’s responses to the inquiry.

On Friday, the university declined to comment on these allegations beyond its official statement.

“Consistent with its policy, CUNY will not comment on the accuracy of the investigation referenced in the articles because no final action as to this investigation has been taken,” the statement said.

“CUNY is committed to ensuring that its investigative processes are held to the highest procedural and ethical standards and that the fairness of the proceedings is preserved for all parties,” the university added. “To that end, any finding regarding allegations of research misconduct must be reliable and credible.”

"Few Americans Have Gotten the New Covid Shots, C.D.C. Finds

The News
Few Americans have received the latest vaccines against the coronavirus: Just over 7 percent of adults and 2 percent of children had received the shot as of Oct. 14, according to a survey presented on Thursday to scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The uptake is weak even among those most at risk of severe illness. Only one in five people age 75 or older has been vaccinated, along with about 15 percent of those ages 65 to 74, according to the survey of nearly 15,000 people.

Why It Matters: Covid is still dangerous to some Americans.
More than 1,200 people are dying of Covid each week, according to C.D.C. data. “That’s a travesty,” said Dr. David Kimberlin, a pediatrician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who represented the American Academy of Pediatrics at the meeting.

“It’s like an entire neighborhood being wiped out every single week,” Dr. Kimberlin added.

About 16,000 people were hospitalized with Covid in the week ending Oct. 14, compared with nearly 23,000 at the same time last year and more than 44,000 in 2021.

Covid hospitalizations among adults aged 75 and older are two to three times as high as among those aged 65 to 74. Rates of hospitalization are highest among Native Americans, Alaska Natives and Black Americans.

Less than 1 percent of Native Americans and Alaska Natives, and 7.6 percent of Black Americans, had received the vaccine as of Oct. 14.

“I’m really disappointed in the low rates of vaccination, because I think it’s a major missed opportunity to improve our overall level of health,” said Dr. Camille Kotton, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and an adviser to the C.D.C.

Background: The vaccine rollout has been bumpy.
Most people should be able to get the vaccines at no cost through private health insurance, Medicare or Medicaid. Government programs also make the vaccines available for free to children and adults who are underinsured or uninsured, at least through Dec. 31, 2024.

So far, more than 380,000 doses have been administered to uninsured people at more than 24,000 pharmacies.

Still, many people have reported having trouble finding the vaccine at pharmacies, being charged fees or even mistakenly being turned away. At some pharmacies, demand has outstripped supply, leading to canceled appointments.

Dr. Kotton said her clinic and others had received doses of the vaccine only in the past couple of weeks, and she was cautiously optimistic that the immunization rates would pick up.

According to the Health and Human Services Department, 12 million Americans had been vaccinated by Oct. 14. That number grew to 14.8 million in the week after.

About 36 percent of adults age 75 and older in the survey said they would definitely get the shot, while 26 percent said they would probably do so or were still undecided.

Second Opinion: Younger people are less vulnerable.
Some experts have argued that immunity from previous infections and vaccinations is enough to protect most young people from severe illness and death from Covid.

The C.D.C. recommended on Sept. 12 that all Americans age 6 months and older receive at least one dose of the latest Covid shots. At the time, advisers to the agency were united in endorsing the vaccines for those at high risk because of their age, race or health status.

But a few advisers also expressed concern about recommending the shots to younger people, especially children, and young males at higher risk for myocarditis, an uncommon side effect. Relatively young and healthy people are at much lower risk of severe illness.

Still, in some patients, the virus can inflict long-term damage to the heart and other organs.

A Telling Number: Some Americans are just not interested.
About 38 percent of adults in the survey said they would not choose the vaccine for themselves. About the same percentage of parents said they would not have their children immunized.

“We can have the best vaccine in the world, we could have the best ability to access it in the world,” Dr. Kimberlin said, but if 40 percent of people say they don’t want it, he added, “it’s just going to sit on the shelf.”"
"How a Dentist Protects Her Family’s Teeth on Halloween
A dentist shares five tricks for managing treats.

Dr. Apoena Ribeiro is a pediatric dentist and microbiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She’s also a parent.

When her daughter was little and growing up in Brazil, Dr. Ribeiro encouraged her to enjoy a holiday called the Feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian, which involves children collecting large bags of candy. But she also had some strategies for keeping the dental dangers at bay.

Here’s what she did back then, and still does today, to protect her family’s oral health on a candy-laden holiday.

She minimizes grazing.
One sugar-filled night won’t sabotage your oral health, Dr. Ribeiro said — so when her daughter was young, she allowed her to collect and enjoy as much candy as she wanted on sweet-heavy holidays.

Once she’d had her fill, Dr. Ribeiro would ask her daughter to sort her candy into two piles: One for her favorites, which she called her “treasures,” and another for the rejects, which they would donate.

The “treasures” would be stashed away in a cardboard “treasure box” that could only be opened once or twice a week (though once per day is also OK, Dr. Ribeiro said). When the box was open, her daughter could eat as much candy as she wanted. But once she was done eating and it was closed, she would be cut off from the candy until the box was opened again. Then it was time to brush her teeth.

These rules prevented Dr. Ribeiro’s daughter from grazing on candy throughout the day, which could give the cavity-causing bacteria in her mouth more opportunities to feed on sugars and create an environment that could lead to tooth decay. “Free access to the candy is the main problem,” Dr. Ribeiro said.

But if the bacteria can only consume the sugar once a day or once every few days, “they will starve,” she said.

She times candy eating with meals.
The best time to have candy is with or just after a meal, Dr. Ribeiro said. At that point, the bacteria in your mouth may have already filled up on any carbohydrates from the meal, so they’re less able to take advantage of the sugar in the candy. And you produce more saliva when you eat, which helps to rinse the sugar from the candy off your teeth. It also neutralizes acids made by the bacteria that can wear away at your tooth enamel.

For most families, having candy with dinner makes the most sense, since all members are likely to be at home and can brush their teeth just after, she said.

She emphasizes proper brushing right after eating candy.
At least twice per day, Dr. Ribeiro brushes her teeth for at least one minute with toothpaste containing fluoride, and she flosses before brushing at night. Two minutes of careful brushing, which is what’s recommended by the American Dental Association, is even better than one, Dr. Ribeiro said.

Ideally, Dr. Ribeiro tries to brush her teeth right after she has candy, and always brushes before bedtime.

Children should follow the same rules: brushing twice per day — and after they’ve had candy, if possible — and always flossing and brushing before bed.

For children under 5 or 6, she said, parents should brush their teeth for them, and parents should supervise the routine until their children are 8 or 9.

She takes extra care with the worst candies.
Any sticky, gooey or chewy candies that lodge into the grooves and crevices of your teeth can do serious damage. A caramel, for instance, can create a “banquet” for the bacteria in your mouth, Dr. Ribeiro said. And sour candies can increase the risk of damage by making your mouth more acidic, she added.

Chocolate is Dr. Ribeiro’s favorite, in part because it’s less likely to linger on teeth. She still enjoys the gooey and chewy candies, but she makes sure to have them with meals, and she brushes and flosses right after to ensure their remnants don’t stick around.

She makes Halloween a teachable moment.
Dr. Ribeiro knew it would be futile to forbid her daughter from having candy on holidays or at any other time of the year.

It’s more helpful to use Halloween as an opportunity to explain to children how sugar from candy or other popular sources like soda or juice can contribute to tooth decay, and how they can protect their teeth while still enjoying special treats, Dr. Ribeiro said.

This is knowledge that they’ll carry with them beyond Halloween, she said, adding that good dental habits could improve the health of your teeth in the long run.

“This is a concept for life,” she said.

"Is Social Media Addictive? Here’s What the Science Says.
A major lawsuit against Meta has placed a spotlight on our fraught relationship with online social information.

A group of 41 states and the District of Columbia filed suit on Tuesday against Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, contending that the company knowingly used features on its platforms to cause children to use them compulsively, even as the company said that its social media sites were safe for young people.

“Meta has harnessed powerful and unprecedented technologies to entice, engage and ultimately ensnare youth and teens,” the states said in their lawsuit filed in federal court. “Its motive is profit.”

The accusations in the lawsuit raise a deeper question about behavior: Are young people becoming addicted to social media and the internet? Here’s what the research has found.

What Makes Social Media So Compelling?
Experts who study internet use say that the magnetic allure of social media arises from the way the content plays to our neurological impulses and wiring, such that consumers find it hard to turn away from the incoming stream of information.

David Greenfield, a psychologist and founder of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction in West Hartford, Conn., said the devices lure users with some powerful tactics. One is “intermittent reinforcement,” which creates the idea that a user could get a reward at any time. But when the reward comes is unpredictable. “Just like a slot machine,” he said. As with a slot machine, users are beckoned with lights and sounds but, even more powerful, information and reward tailored to a user’s interests and tastes.

Adults are susceptible, he noted, but young people are particularly at risk, because the brain regions that are involved in resisting temptation and reward are not nearly as developed in children and teenagers as in adults. “They’re all about impulse and not a lot about the control of that impulse,” Dr. Greenfield said of young consumers.

Moreover, he said, the adolescent brain is especially attuned to social connections, and “social media is all a perfect opportunity to connect with other people.”

Meta responded to the lawsuit by saying that it had taken many steps to support families and teenagers. “We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,” the company said in a statement.

Does Compulsion Equal Addiction?
For many years, the scientific community typically defined addiction in relation to substances, such as drugs, and not behaviors, such as gambling or internet use. That has gradually changed. In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the official reference for mental health conditions, introduced the idea of internet gaming addiction but said that more study was warranted before the condition could be formally declared.

A subsequent study explored broadening the definition to “internet addiction.” The author suggested further exploring diagnostic criteria and the language, noting, for instance, that terms like “problematic use” and even the word “internet” were open to broad interpretation, given the many forms the information and its delivery can take.

Dr. Michael Rich, the director of the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, said he discouraged the use of the word “addiction” because the internet, if used effectively and with limits, was not merely useful but also essential to everyday life. “I prefer the term ‘Problematic Internet Media Use,” he said, a term that has gained currency in recent years.

Dr. Greenfield agreed that there clearly are valuable uses for the internet and that the definition of how much is too much can vary. But he said there also were clearly cases where excessive use interferes with school, sleep and other vital aspects of a healthy life. Too many young consumers “can’t put it down,” he said. “The internet is a giant hypodermic, and the content, including social media like Meta, are the psychoactive drugs.”

"Bush’s Institute Issues an Urgent Plea for Congress to Renew His AIDS Program
PEPFAR, created by President George W. Bush in 2003 to combat the disease, faces an uncertain future now that its authorizing legislation has lapsed.

The institute founded by President George W. Bush issued an urgent call on Wednesday for Congress to renew the global AIDS program known as PEPFAR, a centerpiece of Mr. Bush’s foreign policy legacy that has become a victim of abortion politics on Capitol Hill.

PEPFAR — the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — has saved an estimated 25 million lives since Mr. Bush founded it 20 years ago. The $6.9 billion program, which Congress has previously reauthorized every five years, has long had bipartisan support and is often cited as a powerful example of America’s moral leadership in the world.

But it faces an uncertain future. The legislation authorizing the program lapsed on Sept. 30 after some House Republicans claimed, without evidence, that the Biden administration was using it to promote abortion overseas. Those Republicans want to attach abortion-related restrictions to PEPFAR that would doom its reauthorization in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

The Bush Institute, which is nonpartisan, has thus far been reluctant to step into the debate.

But in a bipartisan letter signed by more than 30 retired ambassadors, foreign policy luminaries and organizations — including the Carter Center, founded by former President Jimmy Carter — the institute pleaded with Congress to reauthorize the program. It argued that in addition to saving lives, PEPFAR was countering the rising influence of Russia and China and burnishing America’s reputation as a global leader.

“PEPFAR is a model of United States leadership and a source of great national pride,” the letter said. “It is one of the most successful international development programs since World War II. Abandoning it abruptly now would send a bleak message, suggesting we are no longer able to set aside our politics for the betterment of democracies and the world.”

The Fight Against H.I.V.
An estimated 40 million people are living with H.I.V. worldwide. About 10 million of them do not have access to treatment.
Hope for Healthy Aging: Older people with the virus are more vulnerable to heart disease. A recent study showed that a statin drug could significantly lower their risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Drug Delayed: The drugmaker Gilead delayed a promising new H.I.V. treatment, allowing it to extend patents on a blockbuster line of medications, according to internal documents.
A Lifesaving Program: In the 20 years since its inception, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has delivered H.I.V. treatment to more than 20 million people in 54 countries. The program is now under threat.
Injectable PrEP: An injection every two months rather than a daily pill could shield many more women from H.I.V., but the shot is unavailable in places that need it most.
For now, at least, PEPFAR is continuing to operate. But advocates fear that, without the underlying authorization, the program will be subject to budget cuts or even elimination in the future. And they say the program is weaker without the bipartisan imprimatur of Congress.

“The classic conservative talking point is that we don’t want to fund programs that aren’t authorized,” said Keifer Buckingham, the advocacy director at the Open Society Foundations and a longtime PEPFAR supporter. She added, “It’s also fair to say that in global health and global health politics, optics matter.”

Mr. Bush himself did not sign the institute’s letter; people close to him have said he is trying to use his voice judiciously. Among those who signed was Dr. Deborah L. Birx, a senior fellow at the Bush Institute who ran PEPFAR under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald J. Trump, and also served as Mr. Trump’s coronavirus response coordinator.

In an interview on Wednesday, Dr. Birx called on President Biden or his advisers to take a more aggressive role in getting PEPFAR reauthorized. She suggested they convene a small group of House and Senate lawmakers to “say this is personally important to him” and to impress upon Congress the importance of demonstrating to the world “how we work together to illustrate our compassion for others.”

“Someone has to step in and take a leadership role,” she said, adding, “In the end, if reauthorization doesn’t happen, it’s because the current administration didn’t prioritize it and didn’t compromise and find a path forward.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Bush has made no secret that he wants the program reauthorized. Over the summer, he discussed its future with Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, over lunch at the Bush family compound in Maine. In mid-September, he published an opinion piece in The Washington Post urging Congress to save it.

At that time, PEPFAR’s supporters on Capitol Hill thought they were making progress toward breaking the logjam. Representative Barbara Lee, a California Democrat who is a leading proponent of the program, said in an interview then that she was working with a freshman Republican, Representative John James of Michigan, on a bipartisan reauthorization bill.

But the effort was put on hold last month in the face of a possible government shutdown, and it remained stalled while House Republicans wrangled over who would be the next speaker. Dr. Birx said she remained hopeful that the program could be reauthorized by Dec. 1, which is World AIDS Day."
"Why Health Care Workers Are Burning Out

The News
Health workers feel burnout more frequently than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic, while also struggling with symptoms of anxiety and depression, sleep problems and harassment, according to a federal survey of American workers published on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The results offer a rare glimpse of worker morale before and after the peak of the pandemic.

The research compared data from 2018 and 2022 and underscored a dire staffing crisis in the nation’s health work force, which limped through the pandemic amid long hours, high turnover, violence in emergency departments and public vitriol over vaccines, masks and treatments. Hundreds of thousands of medical workers have left their jobs in recent years.

“Prior to Covid, we knew that many hospitals were understaffed, that health care workers were burning out,” Dr. Debra Houry, the chief medical officer at the C.D.C., said in an interview on Tuesday. “I think Covid escalated that, and I think just really strained the system.”

The Toll: Nearly five days of poor mental health a month.
Federal researchers tracked self-reported mental health symptoms among more than a thousand adult workers in 2018 and 2022, including 226 health care workers in 2018 and 325 in 2022.

Compared with other groups surveyed, health care workers reported a substantial jump in poor mental health days in the month prior, from 3.3 in 2018 to 4.5 in 2022. Less than 30 percent of health workers last year described themselves as very happy, a decline from 2018. More than a third reported symptoms of depression, while more than half said they had symptoms of anxiety.

And the percentage of health care workers reporting harassment on the job more than doubled, compared with the rate in 2018.

“Hospitals and other health care entities are microcosms of society,” said Rumay Alexander, who teaches nursing at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and advises the American Nurses Association. “Whatever is happening out in the world walks into our health care facilities.”

Nearly half of health care workers surveyed said they were somewhat or very likely to look for new work, the researchers found — an ominous sign for providers already struggling to retain staff. Dr. Houry said that statistic jumped out at her more than any other in the survey.

Expert Diagnosis: Medical institutions are failing workers.
The survey showed a decrease in the odds of burnout if health workers received help from supervisors, had enough time to do their work and trusted management.

But efforts by medical institutions to address the mental health of their workers have been uneven at best, experts said.

Dr. Amy Locke, the chief wellness officer at University of Utah Health, said that medical workers, many of whom are poorly paid, were especially vulnerable to overwork in environments with understaffing and huge financial and moral pressures to perform.

“You get this mentality of, Oh, I can do it. I can do it by myself. And I can do it because people are counting on me,” she said.

Dr. Locke, whose institution received a federal grant for health worker wellness, added that the financial pressures on health providers were even greater now than pre-Covid. “It’s hard for a health system to think, I’m going to pour a lot of money into my people when I need to keep the lights on,” she said.

Who’s Suffering: Nurses and local health workers are particularly vulnerable.
Burnout from work conditions has been especially acute for nurses.

Katie Carroll, a nurse at a hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., said that 10 nurses in her unit had left in the last two years or so, around half of the nursing staff. “You’re running around so busy with a frazzled mind that more mistakes can happen, because there’s so much on your plate,” she said.

Local health departments, often the target of public hectoring during the pandemic, have also suffered. Scott Lockard, the public health director of the Kentucky River District Health Department, said on Tuesday that his 130 employees, who make an average of $23 an hour, were busy regaining their focus and energy.

His department organized a staff celebration over the summer at a local park. “We’ve done activities around mission, vision, values — to anchor ourselves again,” he said. “So people know why we’re doing what we do.”"
"What to Know About Dengue Fever as Cases Spread to New Places
Dengue, the excruciating mosquito-borne disease, is surging throughout the world and coming to places that had never had it. California just confirmed a rare U.S. case.

Cases of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral illness that can be fatal, are surging around the world. The increase is occurring both in places that have long struggled with the disease and in areas where its spread was unheard-of until the last year or two, including France, Italy and Chad, in central Africa. Last week, health officials in Pasadena, Calif., reported a first case of locally transmitted dengue.

What is dengue fever and why is it becoming more widespread?
Dengue, a viral fever, is transmitted by Aedes species of mosquitoes. It can cause excruciating joint pain; is also known by the grim nickname “breakbone fever.”

The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which has been driving many of the current outbreaks, is native to Africa, where it originally lived in forests and fed on animals. But decades ago it spread to the rest of the world via trade routes and adapted to thrive in urban areas, feeding on people and breeding in small bits of trapped water in places such as old tires, discarded bottle caps and trays used to catch air-conditioner drips.

Now as more people move to urban areas — many to lower-quality housing in developing countries — they are more vulnerable to the virus. And climate change is bringing the mosquito to new places, where it is thriving.

“Aedes mosquitoes thrive in warm and humid environments, so definitely climate change and rising temperatures and also extreme weather events are helping extend their habitat range,”  said Dr. Gabriela Paz-Bailey, chief of the dengue branch at the division of vector-borne diseases at the U.S. National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.

How dangerous is it?
Only one in four dengue cases are symptomatic. Some infections may produce only a mild flulike illness. But others can result in dreadful symptoms, including headache, vomiting, high fever and the aching joint pain. Full recovery can take weeks.

About 5 percent of people who get sick will progress to what’s called severe dengue, which causes plasma, the protein-rich fluid component of blood, to leak out of blood vessels. Some patients may go into shock, causing organ failure.

Severe dengue has a mortality rate of between 2 and 5 percent in people whose symptoms are treated. When left untreated, however, the mortality rate is 15 percent.

Severe dengue may go untreated because patients live far from medical care or can’t afford it, or because hospitals are overwhelmed with cases during an outbreak.

Or it can happen when dengue isn’t diagnosed in time because it’s appearing in a new area. That is a problem in resource-strapped countries such as Chad, of course, but also a challenge for a patient or clinician in Pasadena who is unfamiliar with dengue, Dr. Paz-Bailey said.

Who is at risk?

Forty percent of people globally live in areas where they are at risk of dengue infection; the disease is most common in tropical countries such as Brazil.

The people most vulnerable to dengue live in housing that doesn’t keep mosquitoes away from them. In studies on communities along the U.S. southern border in areas where the aegypti mosquito is well established, researchers found that there were as many or sometimes even more of the mosquitoes on the Texas side, but far fewer dengue cases there than on the Mexican side.

That is because more people on the U.S. side of the border had screened windows and air-conditioners, which limited their exposure to mosquitoes, and lived farther apart and were less social: By making fewer visits to friends and relatives, they were less likely to take the virus into new areas where a mosquito might pick it up from them and pass it on.

It is unlikely that dengue will become a serious problem in the United States, “as long as people keeping living like they’re living now,” said Thomas W. Scott, a dengue epidemiologist and professor emeritus at University of California, Davis.

Outside Puerto Rico and other territories where the disease is endemic, there are about 550 dengue cases each year in the United States, but they are imported by travelers who were infected abroad and passed the disease along to their close contacts.

The case in Pasadena is a rare locally acquired case of dengue in the United States. City officials said on Friday that they had been trapping and testing mosquitoes in the neighborhood where the case was reported and had not found any further insects with the virus.

But scientists say dengue will continue to spread to places that haven’t experienced it before.

In addition to climate change, rising rates of urbanization around the world are playing a role, said Alex Perkins, who is an associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Notre Dame and an expert in the mathematical modeling of dengue transmission. If people have recently come from rural areas, they are unlikely to have priority immunity, so the virus can move swiftly through the population.

“I don’t think that the case in Pasadena or anything else that I’ve seen lately is an indication of any looming crisis in the United States in the short term,” Dr. Perkins said. “But I think the general expectation that this is going to be a growing problem in the United States is reasonable.”

Dr. Perkins said the experience of southern China offers a cautionary tale: Historically, the region saw only a handful of dengue cases each year. Then in 2014, there were 42,000 cases in Guangdong Province. “All of a sudden in one year, it grew by a couple of orders of magnitude without any real forewarning,” he said.

He added, “In endemic settings, we’re continuing to have record years, year in and year out, and that’s what’s driving all these imported cases in the United States and elsewhere. And when it comes to the more marginal transmission settings such as the southern United States, southern Europe, China — it’s not getting better there either. So it’s really getting better nowhere: it’s all bad.”

Is there treatment for dengue?
There is at present no specific treatment for dengue infection, and patients are given only symptom management, such as medication to control pain. Drug companies have antivirals in clinical trials.

Is there a vaccine?
The effort to find a dengue vaccine has been long and complicated. Dengvaxia, a vaccine developed by the French firm Sanofi, was rolled out widely in countries such as the Philippines and Brazil starting in 2015, but two years later the company said it was causing vaccinated people who caught the virus to have more severe cases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends use of Dengvaxia in endemic areas for people with a laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection.

The World Health Organization recently recommended a new vaccine called QDENGA, which can be used regardless of prior infection status, for children aged 6 to 16 living in areas with high dengue transmission. This vaccine has already been introduced in Indonesia, Brazil, Thailand and 16 European countries, including Britain and Italy, but it won’t be available in the U.S. any time soon. Takeda, the Japanese company that makes it, withdrew it from the F.D.A. approval process in July after a dispute over what data was being considered.

 What else can we do?
Some countries that have acted aggressively against dengue have controlled it. Singapore uses a combination of methods, including the inspection of homes and construction sites for breeding areas, with high fines for rules violations. “It’s a successful approach but they have a really large budget to support those activities, but not every country has that,” Dr. Paz-Bailey said.

Brazil and Colombia have had success using a bacteria called Wolbachia: When Aedes aegypti is infected with the bacteria, it can no longer pass on the dengue virus. Projects there are mass-producing mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, and releasing them to breed with wild insects in an effort to get the bacteria through the mosquito population."
"Covid Shots May Slightly Raise Stroke Risk in the Oldest Recipients
A federal study hinted at increased risk when the vaccine was given with the high-dose flu shot, but the research is far from conclusive.

The Covid vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may be linked to a slight increase in the risk of stroke when administered along with a high-dose flu vaccine, according to a new analysis by the Food and Drug Administration.

The high-dose flu vaccine is usually given to older people, and the risk association is clearest in adults aged 85 and older. But that increase, if real, seems very small, and it is possible that the risk may stem from the flu vaccine alone.

A separate analysis by the agency points to a small increase in the incidence of seizures after Covid vaccinations in children ages 2 to 5. The papers were posted online last week, and have not yet been vetted for publication in a scientific journal. Experts in vaccine safety said the studies were well done.

Neither study is definitive, and even if these links were confirmed, the increases are so slight that the benefits of vaccination still far outweigh the risks, especially in older adults, experts said. Flu and Covid themselves both raise the risk of stroke.

Although the findings do not warrant a change to vaccine recommendations, they are suggestive enough to merit further study, the experts said.

“Without these types of efforts, the absence of data, the absence of evidence, just leads to a lot of misperceptions,” said Dr. Susan Cheng, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles.

The F.D.A. did not make the researchers available for interviews. In a statement, Cherie Duvall-Jones, a spokeswoman for the agency, said it was “making this information known at this time through publication of this paper for transparency.”

Both studies are based on observational data, which cannot identify cause and effect. The agency is planning to study the occurrence of seizures in children after vaccination “using a more robust design,” Ms. Duvall-Jones said.

“Sometimes, similar small associations of increased risk are not confirmed upon further investigation,” she added.

Administration of flu and Covid vaccines at the same time — or with a single shot that combines both, once one becomes available — is an increasingly popular strategy with health officials aiming to increase vaccine uptake and ease logistical burdens, said Marco Cavaleri, who heads the office of biological health threats and vaccines strategy at the European Medicines Agency.

More on Covid-19
N95 Companies: Project N95 and Mask-C, two face mask providers, said they were closing, a sign of the slow and steady decline of what was once a much-sought-after item.
Omicron: In the two years since its emergence, the dominant variant of the coronavirus has proved to be not only staggeringly infectious, but an evolutionary marvel, challenging many assumptions virologists had before the pandemic.
Long Covid: As more young Americans report serious cognitive problems, scientists suggest that the increase captures the effects of long Covid, most likely in addition to other effects of the pandemic, including psychological distress.
Stroke Risk: The Covid vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may be linked to a slight increase in the risk of stroke when administered along with a high-dose flu vaccine that is usually given to older people, according to a new analysis by the F.D.A.
“That’s the way for the future,” Dr. Cavaleri said. “We, of course, need to be sure that indeed this is a good strategy also from a safety perspective.”

Dr. Cavaleri said he was not yet convinced that the increase in stroke risk was real. Strokes and related health problems occur frequently among those aged 85 or older, he noted. “We have to be extremely careful in not overinterpreting data before we get really large data sets, maybe from different regions, that could tell us exactly what is going on,” he said.

Officials in the United States first noted a possible association about a year ago. At the time, data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a federal safety surveillance system, suggested that Americans aged 65 or older might be at increased risk of an ischemic stroke, which interrupts blood supply to the brain, within 21 days of receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine offered last fall.

But federal officials said in January that a deeper investigation suggested that a link was “very unlikely,” and that other surveillance systems, including those in other countries, had not found a connection.

In the new study, researchers at the F.D.A. and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services analyzed stroke risk among nearly 5.4 million Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older. They looked at the health records of those who received a Covid bivalent shot either on its own or along with the flu vaccine between Aug. 31 and Nov. 6, 2022.

Their initial analysis found no statistically significant increases in stroke with the Covid vaccines administered by themselves. When federal researchers broke down the data by age, they found an increased risk of stroke among those who were 85 years or older who got the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and in those who were 65 to 74 who got the Moderna vaccine.

The link was most consistent when the bivalent Covid shot was given at the same time as a high-dose flu vaccine or one containing an adjuvant, a chemical added to elicit a stronger immune response.

Those who received both Covid and flu vaccines saw a 20 percent increase in the risk of ischemic stroke with the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent shot, and an increase of 35 percent in the risk of transient ischemic stroke after the Moderna bivalent shot. (The bivalent shots were replaced in September with new formulations.)

The researchers then looked more closely at the relationship between the flu vaccine and stroke in nearly 7 million Medicare participants who received a high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine. They found a small but statistically significant increase, of about 9 percent, in the risk of stroke after receiving the flu vaccine alone.

The results suggest that the high-dose flu vaccine itself may be responsible for the increase in strokes observed in the study, Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said.

The study found some odd patterns, however — for example, an increased risk of some types of stroke with the flu vaccine in those ages 65 to 74 and those 85 or older, but not among those who were 75 to 84.

“That’s the sort of thing that would make me wonder if there might be something weird going on in their data, because you would expect there to be more consistency,” Dr. Salmon said.

Federal researchers also calculated a separate measure called attributable risk, or the increase in risk that can be attributed to the exposure. Except in those 85 or older, the attributable risk was roughly three additional cases of stroke for every 100,000 people vaccinated with the Covid vaccine.

The numbers are too small to warrant alarm, Dr. Salmon said, especially because the diseases themselves also carry a risk of stroke.

“If I tell you that your risk of getting struck by lightning doubled, I wouldn’t really sweat it, to be honest with you, because your risk of getting hit by lightning is pretty small,” he said. “Because the background rate is so small, a doubling of that risk isn’t very much.”

Experts also said they were not surprised or concerned by the findings regarding seizures among vaccinated children.

In that study, F.D.A. researchers looked at the incidence of 21 health outcomes in more than 4.1 million children after immunization with the original Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax.

The researchers based their analysis on commercial claims in insurance databases, as well as vaccination data from local and state systems.

The analysis confirmed a previously observed risk of uncommon heart problems after the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid shots in children aged 12 to 17.

The study also detected a small rise in the incidence of seizures and convulsions after the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech shots, but only among children aged 2 to 5.

A consistent trend in seizures across all age groups would have been more worrisome. But young children are prone to seizures when they have a high fever, Dr. Cheng said, and other vaccines that produce fevers are known to induce seizures in very young children.

“We know that the Covid vaccines can cause a fever, so it’s not a terribly surprising finding if it’s true,” Dr. Salmon said of the seizures.

Children are at much smaller risk of Covid than older adults, so many parents have opted not to vaccinate them. The low numbers make it challenging to study potential risks, experts noted.

“I commend them for doing the work,” Dr. Salmon said of the F.D.A.’s research. “I do wish they were done earlier, but it’s great that the studies are being done.”"
"Dr. Donlin Long, Wide-Ranging Medical Innovator, Is Dead at 89
A neurosurgeon, he helped develop an insulin pump for diabetes patients and a device to relieve pain, and joined Ben Carson in a historic operation on conjoined infants.

Donlin M. Long, a pioneering neurosurgeon whose brain research helped millions of patients manage pain and who collaborated on the invention of an implantable pump to deliver insulin to people with diabetes, died on Sept. 19 near Gettysburg, Pa. He was 89.

The cause was complications of a fall he suffered while fly-fishing for trout in a stream near his weekend home, his daughter Dr. Kimberly Page Riley said. Dr. Long was a resident of North Baltimore and chairman of the neurosurgery department at Johns Hopkins University for 17 years.

In addition to the insulin pump, Dr. Long, as an expert in relieving chronic pain, had a collaborative hand in introducing, in 1981, the first battery-powered, rechargeable, implantable electronic device to stimulate peripheral nerves to relieve pain, according to Johns Hopkins. The device, known as TENS, for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, became a standard medical tool.

As an accomplished practitioner of skull base surgery, Dr. Long was also instrumental in the first successful separation of twin infants born conjoined at the head. The operation, performed in 1987, involved 70 surgeons, nurses and assistants and lasted 22 hours.

The twins’ brains were separated, and one of the infants’ skulls was closed by Dr. Benjamin S. Carson, whom Dr. Long, the founding chairman of the department of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, had recruited to the university. The operation, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, brought Dr. Carson instant fame. He was later a Republican presidential candidate and secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Donald J. Trump.

Dr. Long, Dr. Carson’s mentor, closed the other boy’s skull during the operation.

Drs. Long and Carson had just one hour to accomplish final separation, to reconstruct the divided brain cavities and veins, and to restart the hearts in the infants, both of them boys.

Dr. Patrick J. Connolly, the chief of neurosurgery at Virtua Mount Holly Hospital in New Jersey and a professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, hailed Dr. Long’s contributions to neurosurgery as well as to two other specialties, the treatment of vascular and spinal diseases.

“We use steroids to treat brain edema every day in neurosurgery thanks to Dr. Long’s research in the early ’70s,” he said, “and his contribution to spinal cord stimulation has permitted relief of suffering for millions of people over the last 50 or so years.”

When Dr. Long arrived at Johns Hopkins in 1973, the neurosurgery department had only five full time surgeons, performing some 125 surgeries a year. By the time he retired in 2000, the full-time staff had more than doubled and the number of operations had soared to more than 3,500 annually, performed at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.

He was instrumental in Johns Hopkins’ decision to erect the Adolf Meyer Center in 1981, uniting the departments of neurosurgery, neurology and psychiatry in one building and facilitating collaboration among them.

Dr. Long’s research into chronic pain prepared him to help design the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator at Johns Hopkins. Later in the 1980s, he collaborated with colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory to invent the implantable medication pump to treat diabetic patients.

Many of the surgeons trained during Dr. Long’s tenure at Johns Hopkins were hired as full professors, as leaders of neurosurgery departments at hospitals and universities, and as heads of professional associations.

“Neurosurgeons everywhere stand on his shoulders,” Dr. Connolly said.

Donlin Martin Long Jr. was born on April 14, 1934, in Rolla, Mo., in the southwest Ozarks. He was a descendant of New England Quakers, one of whom, according to a Johns Hopkins biography, had blazed a trail through the Cumberland Gap in the Appalachians alongside Daniel Boone. His father, Donlin Sr., was a chemist for the state health department. His mother, Davine (Johnson) Long, was a teacher.

Raised in Jefferson City, Mo., Dr. Long earned undergraduate and medical degrees, in 1955 and 1959, from the University of Missouri. He received a doctorate in neuroanatomy in 1964 from the University of Minnesota, where he had planned to become a cardiac surgeon before changing course and focusing on neurosurgery, inspired by the work of Dr. Lyle A. French in that field.

As residents at Minnesota, he and Joseph Galicich conducted research that led to the use of steroids to reduce postoperative brain swelling.

Dr. Long told The New York Times in 1987 that “chronic pain is the weakest area of modern medicine and the least well managed of any complaint or disease.”

He is survived by his wife, Harriett (Kallenbach) Long; another daughter, Elisabeth Merchant Long; a son, David; and four grandchildren. His three children have all taught or worked as administrators at Johns Hopkins.

Remembered for his equanimity, his role as a mentor and his can-do passion, Dr. Long often told his children and grandchildren, “There is no try, only did and did not.”"
"Meta Accused by States of Using Features to Lure Children to Instagram and Facebook

The News
Meta was sued by more than three dozen states on Tuesday for knowingly using features on Instagram and Facebook to hook children to its platforms, even as the company said its social media sites were safe for young people.

Colorado and California led a joint lawsuit filed by 33 states in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, saying Meta — which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger — violated consumer protection laws by unfairly ensnaring children and deceiving users about the safety of its platforms. The District of Columbia and eight other states filed separate lawsuits on Tuesday against Meta with most of the same claims.

In their complaint, the states said Meta had “designed psychologically manipulative product features to induce young users’ compulsive and extended use” of platforms like Instagram. The company’s algorithms were designed to push children and teenagers into rabbit holes of toxic and harmful content, the states said, with features like “infinite scroll” and persistent alerts used to hook young users. The attorneys general also charged Meta with violating a federal children’s online privacy law, accusing it of unlawfully collecting “the personal data of its youngest users” without their parents’ permission.

“Meta has harnessed powerful and unprecedented technologies to entice, engage, and ultimately ensnare youth and teens,” the states said in their 233-page lawsuit. “Its motive is profit.”

Meta said it was working to provide a safer environment for teenagers on its apps and has introduced more than 30 tools to support teenagers and families.

“We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,” the company said in a statement.

Why the Case Matters
It’s unusual for so many states to come together to sue a tech giant for consumer harms. The coordination shows states are prioritizing the issue of children and online safety and combining legal resources to fight Meta, just as states had previously done for cases against Big Tobacco and Big Pharma companies.

“Just like Big Tobacco and vaping companies have done in years past, Meta chose to maximize its profits at the expense of public health, specifically harming the health of the youngest among us,” Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, said in a statement.

Lawmakers around the globe have been trying to rein in platforms like Instagram and TikTok on behalf of children. Over the past few years, Britain, followed by states like California and Utah, passed laws to require social media platforms to boost privacy and safety protections for minors online. The Utah law, among other things, would require social media apps to turn off notifications by default for minors overnight to reduce interruptions to children’s sleep.

Regulators have also tried to hold social media companies accountable for possible harms to young people. Last year, a coroner in Britain ruled that Instagram had contributed to the death of a teenager who took her own life after seeing thousands of images of self-harm on the platform.

Laws to protect the safety of children online in the United States, however, have stalled in Congress as tech companies lobby against them.

“We’ve been warning about Meta’s manipulation and harming of young people from its start and sadly it has taken years to hold it and other companies like Google accountable,” said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of consumer advocacy at the Center for Digital Democracy. “Hopefully justice will be served but this is why it’s so crucial to have regulations.”

How the Investigation Started
States began investigating Instagram’s potentially harmful effects on young people several years ago as public concerns over cyberbullying and teen mental health mounted.

In early 2021, Facebook announced that it was planning to develop “Instagram Kids,” a version of its popular app that would be aimed at users younger than 13. The news prompted a backlash among concerned lawmakers and children’s groups.

Soon after, a group of attorneys general from more than 40 states wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive. In it, they said that Facebook had “historically failed to protect the welfare of children on its platforms” and urged the company to abandon its plans for Instagram Kids.

Concerns among the attorneys general intensified in September 2021 after Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee, leaked company research indicating that the company knew its platforms posed mental health risks to young people. Facebook then announced it was pausing the development of Instagram Kids.

That November, a bipartisan group of attorneys general, including Colorado, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, announced a joint investigation into Instagram’s impact — and potential harmful effects — on young people.

Remedies
Under local and state consumer protection laws, the attorneys general are seeking financial penalties from Meta. The District of Columbia and the states are also asking the court for injunctive relief to force the company to stop using certain tech features that the states contend have harmed young users.

What Happens Next
Meta is expected to fight to dismiss the case. Mr. Weiser, the Colorado attorney general, said in a news conference that he filed the lawsuit because he wasn’t able to reach a settlement with the company. He noted that Meta had filed a motion to dismiss a separate lawsuit filed by consumers, which accuses the company of similar allegations of harms toward children and teenagers.

Separately, a group of attorneys general from more than 40 states is pursuing an investigation into user engagement practices at TikTok and their possible harmful effects on young people. That investigation, which was announced in 2022, is ongoing."
"How Aid in Dying Became Medical, Not Moral
The debate over aid in dying still rages in the language that medicine and the media use to describe the practice.

In rural Iowa, Peg Sandeen recalls, living with AIDS meant living under the cloud of your neighbors’ judgment. After her husband, John, fell ill in 1992, the rumors began swirling. The couple had almost learned to live with the stigma when things took a turn for the worse.

In 1993, ravaged by his disease and running out of options, John wanted to make one final decision: to die on his own terms, with the help of life-ending medication. But at the time, there was no way to convey to his doctors what he wanted. As the debate over assisted dying raged in far-off Oregon, the headlines offered up only loaded words: murder, euthanasia, suicide.

John was adamant that what he wanted was not suicide. He loved his life: his wife, who had married him even though he had asked her to leave when he learned he was H.I.V. positive; their 2-year-old daughter, Hannah; and playing Neil Young songs on guitar, a pleasure that was rapidly being taken from him as his faculties slipped away.

“This was not a man who wanted to commit suicide, at all,” said Ms. Sandeen, now the chief executive of Death With Dignity, a group that supports aid-in-dying laws across the country. To her, the word only added more judgment to the homophobia and AIDS phobia that they — and others who found themselves in a similar position — were facing.

John had expressed to his wife his wish to die on his own terms. But, to her knowledge, he never spoke about it with his physicians. At the time, it felt impossible to bring it up as simply a medical question, not a moral one.

“Even if the answer was, ‘No, we can’t offer that,’ that would have made such a difference,” she said. “We were just facing so much stigma that even to have the ability to have this end-of-life care conversation would have just been remarkable.”

John succumbed to the virus on Dec. 9, 1993, less than a year before the Death With Dignity Act passed narrowly in Oregon. Since its enactment in 1997, more than 3,700 Oregonians have taken measures permitted by the law, which allows patients with a terminal illness and the approval of two doctors to receive life-ending medication. The practice is now legal in 10 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.

With this shift has come new language. Like the Sandeens, many health advocates and medical professionals insist that a terminally ill patient taking medication to hasten the end is doing something fundamentally different from suicide. The term “medical aid in dying,” they say, is meant to emphasize that someone with a terminal diagnosis is not choosing whether but how to die.

“There is a significant, a meaningful difference between someone seeking to end their life because they have a mental illness, and someone seeking to end their life who is going to die in the very near future anyway,” said Dr. Matthew Wynia, director of the University of Colorado’s Center for Bioethics and Humanities.

In the 1990s, advocates were facing an uphill battle for support. Two assisted-dying bills, in California and Washington, had failed, and the advocates now faced an opposition campaign that mischaracterized the practice as doctor-prescribed death. “At the time, the issue very badly needed to be rebranded and repositioned,” said Eli Stutsman, a lawyer and a main author of the Death With Dignity Act. “And that’s what we did.”

The text of the law, however, only defined the practice by what it was not: mercy killing, homicide, suicide or euthanasia. (In the United States, euthanasia means that a physician actively administers the life-ending substance. That practice has never been legal in the United States, although it is in Canada.)

New terms soon became inevitable. Barbara Coombs Lee, an author of the law and president at the time of the advocacy group Compassion and Choices, remembers a meeting in 2004 where her group discussed which terminology to use going forward. The impetus “was probably another frustrated conversation about another interminable interview with a reporter who insisted on calling it suicide,” she said.

A phrase like “medical aid in dying,” they concluded, would reassure patients that they were taking part in a process that was regulated and medically sanctioned. “Medicine has that legitimating power, like it or not,” says Anita Hannig, an anthropologist at Brandeis University and author of the book “The Day I Die: The Untold Story of Assisted Dying in America.” “That really removes a lot of the stigma.”

By contrast, words like “suicide” could have a devastating effect on patients and their families, as Dr. Hannig learned in her research. Grieving relatives might be left feeling shamed, isolated or unsupported by strangers or acquaintances who assumed that the loved one had “suicided.” Dying patients often hid their true wishes from their doctors, because they feared judgment or struggled to reconcile their personal views on suicide.

Unlike an older term, “physician aid in dying,” “medical aid in dying” also centered on the patient. “This is not a decision the physician’s making — this is not even a suggestion the physician is making,” said Ms. Coombs Lee, who has worked as an emergency-room nurse and a physician assistant. “The physician’s role is really secondary.”

An equally important consideration was how the phrase would be taken up by the medical community. Doctors in Oregon were already practicing aid in dying and publishing research on it. But without agreed-upon terms, they either defaulted to “assisted suicide” (generally used by opponents of the law) or “death with dignity” (the term chosen by advocates for the name of the law). A more neutral phrase, one that doctors could use with each other and in their research, was needed.

Not all organizations today agree that “medical aid in dying” is neutral. The Associated Press Stylebook still advises referring to “physician-assisted suicide,” noting that “aid in dying” is a term used by advocacy groups. The American Medical Association also uses this language: In 2019, a report from the association’s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs concluded that “despite its negative connotations, the term ‘physician assisted suicide’ describes the practice with the greatest precision. Most importantly, it clearly distinguishes the practice from euthanasia.”

Medical language has long shaped — and reshaped — how we understand death. Dr. Hannig noted that the concept of brain death did not exist until 1968. Until then, a patient whose brain activity had ceased but whose heart was still beating was still legally alive. One consequence was that any doctor removing the patient’s organs for transplant would have been committing a crime — a serious concern for a profession that is notoriously fearful of lawsuits.

In 1968, a Harvard Medical School committee came to the conclusion that “irreversible coma,” now known as brain death, should be considered a new criterion for death. This new definition — a legal one, rather than a biological one — has paved the way for organ transplantation around the world. “Before the definition of death was changed, those physicians would be called murderers,” Dr. Hannig said. “Now you have a totally new definition of death.”

Of course, doctors have always assisted patients who sought a better end. But in the past, it was usually in secret and under the shroud of euphemism.

“Back in the day, before the laws were passed, it was known as a wink and a nod,” said Dr. David Grube, a retired family physician in Oregon who began prescribing life-ending medications after one of his terminally ill patient violently took his own life. He knew doctors in the 1970s and ’80s who prescribed sleeping pills to terminally ill patients and let on that combining them with alcohol would lead to a peaceful death.

For a brief time after the Death With Dignity law was passed, some doctors used the word “hastening” to emphasize that the patient was already dying and that the physician was merely nudging along an unavoidable fate. That term did not catch on, in part because hospices did not like to advertise that they were shortening lives, and patients did not like hearing that hospice care might lead to their “hastening.”

In the absence of other language, the name of the law itself became the preferred term. The phrase allowed patients to open conversations with their physicians without feeling as though they were raising a taboo subject, and doctors understood immediately what was meant. The name has stuck: Even in his retirement, Dr. Grube gets calls from patients asking to talk about “death with dignity.”

Yet in some ways, Dr. Grube believes the use of the word “dignity” was unfortunate. To him, the crucial point is not the kind of death a patient chooses, but that the patient has a choice. “You can have a dignified death when you pull out all the stops and it doesn’t work,” he said. “If that’s what you want, it’s dignified. Dignity is defined by the patient.”

To him, that means avoiding language that heaps judgment on people who are already suffering. “There’s no place for shaming language in end-of-life,” Dr. Grube said. “It shouldn’t be there.”"
"A New Era of Psychedelics in Oregon
The state has pioneered a therapeutic market for psychedelic mushrooms. Researchers are watching with a mix of excitement and unease.

In a carpeted office suite, Alex Beck settled onto a mattress and, under the watch of a trained guide, began chomping through a handful of “Pumpkin Hillbilly” mushrooms.

A Marine Corps veteran who was sexually assaulted during his time in the armed forces, Mr. Beck had long been searching unsuccessfully for a way to put those nightmarish years behind him. Now he was ready for a different kind of journey, a psychedelic trip through the nether regions of his own mind.

As he felt his thoughts starting to spin, his “facilitator,” Josh Goldstein, urged him to surrender and let the mushrooms guide him.

“It’s like the idea of planting a seed and then letting it go,” he said.

Stigmatized in law and medicine for the past half-century, psychedelics are in the midst of a sudden revival, with a growing body of research suggesting that the mind-altering compounds could upend psychiatric care. Governments in several places have cautiously started to open access, and as Oregon voters approved a broad drug decriminalization plan in 2020, they also backed an initiative to allow the use of mushrooms as therapy.

This summer, the state debuted a first-of-its-kind legal market for psilocybin mushrooms, more widely known as magic mushrooms. Far from the days of illicit consumption in basements and vans, the program allows people to embark on a therapeutic trip, purchasing mushrooms produced by a state-approved grower and consuming them in a licensed facility under the guidance of a certified facilitator.

Mr. Beck, 30, was one of the first clients at a facility in the central Oregon city of Bend that began conducting sessions this summer in a building that on other days of the week offers chiropractic services.

In his youth, Mr. Beck had experimented with psychedelics for recreation. But as he struggled with his lingering post-traumatic stress in adulthood, he learned about what seemed to be promising new research into plant-based psychedelics for mental health issues that did not respond to other treatments. He wondered if they could help him clear his head from the horrors of the past.

“I’m trying to reset my brain to where I can look at life in a new way,” he said.

Plants and fungi with psychoactive properties have been used for thousands of years. More modern uses in the United States grew in the 1950s with promising research on LSD and psilocybin, and the substances soon became a signature of the counterculture movement, so much so that political leaders moved to criminalize their use and halt research into their effects.

In altering the normal activity of the brain, psilocybin has the power to distort perceptions, transform senses and bend emotions. Researchers see the possibility of bestowing the brain with new elasticity, allowing people a chance to escape mental ruts. Studies have suggested that breakthroughs may be possible for people with challenging mental health conditions, including PTSD, substance addiction and treatment-resistant depression, without the habit-forming properties of some other drugs.

For those who have long worked on psychedelics research, the sudden expansion in access in Oregon and Colorado, along with cities like Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis and Washington, D.C., have prompted a mix of elation and trepidation. Oregon has settled on a middle-of-the-road approach, requiring neither a doctor’s supervision nor a specific medical diagnosis, but providing for strict oversight of supply and use.

Dr. Janis Phelps, director of the Center for Psychedelic Therapies and Research at the California Institute of Integral Studies, said she and other researchers had been wary of the decriminalization movement. Many in the field had worked for years to remain strictly scientific, hoping to avoid government crackdowns, and to give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration time to fully review the effects of psilocybin before pressing ahead with efforts to make it legal.

“I have changed my mind,” she said. While she remains concerned that bad actors could try to enter the industry strictly for profit, or try to take advantage of vulnerable people, she has come to believe that the open door in Oregon could advance the use of psychedelics in ways that methodical approaches cannot.

Dr. Charles Nemeroff, the chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, said he continues to be wary. Psilocybin is powerful, with immediate effects lasting for hours, and uncertain outcomes for patients, he said, recalling one patient of his who has experienced protracted psychosis, losing partial connection to reality, after taking doses of mushrooms. The treatments ruined her life, said Dr. Nemeroff, who said he worried about the lack of required medical oversight in Oregon’s program.

“I’m really uncomfortable with this,” he said, adding that it could erase progress the field has made. “We’ll end up back in the Nixonian era in which psychedelics could not even be studied.”

While some form of legalized marijuana is authorized in all but 12 states, creating a huge, multi-billion-dollar industry, the psilocybin market remains small, with an uncertain financial outlook for those entering it. Only five businesses are approved to manufacture the therapeutic-use fungi in Oregon, with 13 sites approved to host dosing sessions.

Bend is home to two of them. One offers a treatment experience that costs as much as $15,000, including several days spent getting to know the facilitator and the townhome-like space where the treatment takes place. Mr. Beck, who lives in Bend, connected with another organization known as Bendable, a nonprofit that helps coordinate treatment and asks clients to pay what they can afford.

A single session costs about $3,000, which includes a preparatory meeting, a guided session with the mushrooms that lasts several hours, and a follow-up appointment a few days later in which the client discusses lessons from the session and how to integrate them into their other therapy.

Amanda Gow, the executive director of Bendable, said she opens her email each day to messages from all over the country: a woman in Kentucky desperate for help with her husband’s PTSD, a father in western Oregon willing to try anything to help his adult son’s depression, a single mother in Bend struggling with childhood trauma.

Many described years of therapy, medical visits and antidepressants but little progress. The wait list includes hundreds of people.

Officials in other states are watching what happens in Oregon. Voters in Colorado approved a measure last year to decriminalize psilocybin and to set the state on the path to a legal therapeutic market. In other states, including Texas, lawmakers have authorized studies of psilocybin for treating ailments such as PTSD. The F.D.A. has granted the drug “breakthrough therapy” status, which allows for expedited review of substances that have demonstrated substantial promise.

But there is uncertainty about the best path forward. California lawmakers approved a bill this year to decriminalize several hallucinogens, but Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed the measure, saying the state needs to first set up regulated treatment guidelines. The American Psychiatric Association has urged caution, saying treatments should be limited to research studies for now.

Mr. Goldstein, who works with Bendable and guides sessions for clients, had his first psychedelic experience more than three decades ago and spent recent years facilitating underground mushroom sessions. He does not have a medical degree but previously worked as an academic director at a therapeutic boarding school.

Not all of the sessions he has supervised have been pleasant. One client, Mr. Goldstein said, recently had her first psychedelic session and hated it, asking for it to end soon after it began. It lasted six hours. He said such experiences highlight the importance of guided sessions, with someone able to help people navigate the experience. Even a difficult session, he said, can help clients gain insight into why they were struggling so much with what was on their mind.

“Those can be better than the people who just see rainbows and unicorns,” he said.

For his treatment session, Mr. Beck arrived in the morning to the office suite. Mr. Beck lit a candle and Mr. Goldstein put on a playlist of music that traces an arc of a psilocybin experience, beginning with calming tracks with titles such as “Flute Traveller” and “Unlocking the Doors of Eternity.”

Once the mushrooms took hold, as Mr. Beck described it later, he felt himself beginning to thrash, but Mr. Goldstein said he had remained largely calm. Mr. Beck recalled visions of colorful strands of ribbon floating through his mind, wrapping themselves around different issues that he had prepared himself to tackle —  the sexual assault, the PTSD, various difficult relationships.

As the mushrooms began to wear off after several hours, he was tearful. He told Mr. Goldstein about realizing how important family was to him. For the first time, he said, he decided he wanted to have children of his own some day.

The following day, Mr. Beck and Mr. Goldstein met at a park to discuss the experience and how to integrate it into Mr. Beck’s more traditional therapy.

“I had been holding on to so many traumas and issues,” Mr. Beck said. “It was like a massive weight had been released.”

Still, there is more to do. Mr. Beck continues in his traditional therapy and plans to increase the frequency of those sessions, which he has found productive with more clarity about what needs to be discussed. The treatments have complemented each other, he said.

“I wouldn’t say it’s a ‘one and done, I’m completely cured,’” he said. “It takes work.”"
"A Hospice Nurse on Embracing the Grace of Dying

A decade ago, Hadley Vlahos was lost. She was a young single mother, searching for meaning and struggling to make ends meet while she navigated nursing school. After earning her degree, working in immediate care, she made the switch to hospice nursing and changed the path of her life. Vlahos, who is 31, found herself drawn to the uncanny, intense and often unexplainable emotional, physical and intellectual gray zones that come along with caring for those at the end of their lives, areas of uncertainty that she calls “the in-between.” That’s also the title of her first book, which was published this summer. “The In-Between: Unforgettable Encounters During Life’s Final Moments” is structured around her experiences — tragic, graceful, earthy and, at times, apparently supernatural — with 11 of her hospice patients, as well as her mother-in-law, who was also dying. The book has so far spent 13 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. “It’s all been very surprising,” says Vlahos, who despite her newfound success as an author and her two-million-plus followers on social media, still works as a hospice nurse outside New Orleans. “But I think that people are seeing their loved ones in these stories.”

What should more people know about death? I think they should know what they want. I’ve been in more situations than you could imagine where people just don’t know. Do they want to be in a nursing home at the end or at home? Organ donation? Do you want to be buried or cremated? The issue is a little deeper here: Someone gets diagnosed with a terminal illness, and we have a culture where you have to “fight.” That’s the terminology we use: “Fight against it.” So the family won’t say, “Do you want to be buried or cremated?” because those are not fighting words. I have had situations where someone has had terminal cancer for three years, and they die, and I say: “Do they want to be buried or cremated? Because I’ve told the funeral home I’d call.” And the family goes, “I don’t know what they wanted.” I’m like, We’ve known about this for three years! But no one wants to say: “You are going to die. What do you want us to do?” It’s against that culture of “You’re going to beat this.”

Is it hard to let go of other people’s sadness and grief at the end of a day at work? Yeah. There’s this moment, especially when I’ve taken care of someone for a while, where I’ll walk outside and I’ll go fill up my gas tank and it’s like: Wow, all these other people have no idea that we just lost someone great. The world lost somebody great, and they’re getting a sandwich. It is this strange feeling. I take some time, and mentally I say: “Thank you for allowing me to take care of you. I really enjoyed taking care of you.” Because I think that they can hear me.

The idea in your book of “the in-between” is applied so starkly: It’s the time in a person’s life when they’re alive, but death is right there. But we’re all living in the in-between every single moment of our lives. We are.

So how might people be able to hold on to appreciation for that reality, even if we’re not medically near the end? It’s hard. I think it’s important to remind ourselves of it. It’s like, you read a book and you highlight it, but you have to pick it back up. You have to keep reading it. You have to. Until it really becomes a habit to think about it and acknowledge it.

I was reading these articles recently about how scientists are pursuing breakthroughs that could extend the human life span to one hundred twenty.1 There’s some part of people that thinks they can cheat death — and, of course, you can’t. But what do you think about the prospect of extending the human life span? I don’t want to live to be 120. I have spent enough time around people who are close to 100, over 100, to know that once you start burying your children, you’re ready. Personally, I’ve never met someone 100 or older who still wants to be alive. I have this analogy that I did a TikTok2 on. This is from having a conversation with someone over 100, and her feeling is that you start with your Earth room when you’re born: You have your parents, your grandparents, your siblings. As you get older, your Earth room starts to have more people: You start making friends and college roommates and relationships. Then you start having kids. And at some point, people start exiting and going to the next room: the afterlife. From what she told me, it’s like you get to a point when you’re older that you start looking at what that other room would be, the afterlife room,3 and being like, I miss those people. It’s not because you don’t love the people on Earth, but the people you built your life with are no longer here. I have been around so many people who are that age, and a majority of them — they’re ready to go see those people again.

“The In-Between” also has to do with the experience of being in between uncertainty and knowing. But how much uncertainty is there for you? Because in the book you write about things that you can’t explain, like people who are close to death telling you that they’re seeing their dead loved ones again. But then you write, “I do believe that our loved ones come to get us when we pass.”4 So where is the uncertainty? The uncertainty I have is what after this life looks like. People ask me for those answers, and I don’t have them. No one does. I feel like there is something beyond, but I don’t know what it is. When people are having these in-between experiences of seeing deceased loved ones, sometimes it is OK to ask what they’re seeing. I find that they’ll say, “Oh, I’m going on a trip,” or they can’t seem to find the words to explain it. So the conclusion I’ve come to is whatever is next cannot be explained with the language and the knowledge that we have here on Earth.

Do these experiences feel religious to you? No, and that was one of the most convincing things for me. It does not matter what their background is — if they believe in nothing, if they are the most religious person, if they grew up in a different country, rich or poor. They all tell me the same things. And it’s not like a dream, which is what I think a lot of people think it is. Like, Oh, I went to sleep, and I had a dream. What it is instead is this overwhelming sense of peace. People feel this peace, and they will talk to me, just like you and I are talking, and then they will also talk to their deceased loved ones. I see that over and over again: They are not confused; there’s no change in their medications. Other hospice nurses, people who have been doing this longer than me, or physicians, we all believe in this.

Do you have a sense of whether emergency-room nurses5 report similar things? I interned in the E.R., and the nurse I was shadowing said that no one who works in the E.R. believes in an afterlife. I asked myself: Well, how do I know who’s correct? How am I supposed to know? Are the people in the church that I was raised with6 more correct than all these people? How are you supposed to know what’s right and what’s not?

But you’ve made a choice about what you believe. So what makes you believe it? I totally get it: People are like, I don’t know what you’re talking about. So, OK, medically someone’s at the end of their life. Many times — not all the time — there will be up to a minute between breaths. That can go on for hours. A lot of times there will be family there, and you’re pretty much just staring at someone being like, When is the last breath going to come? It’s stressful. What is so interesting to me is that almost everyone will know exactly when it is someone’s last breath. That moment. Not one minute later. We are somehow aware that a certain energy is not there. I’ve looked for different explanations, and a lot of the explanations do not match my experiences.

That reminds me of how people say someone just gives off a bad vibe. Oh, I totally believe in bad vibes.

But I think there must be subconscious cues that we’re picking up that we don’t know how to measure scientifically. That’s different from saying it’s supernatural. We might not know why, but there’s nothing magic going on. You don’t have any kind of doubts?

None. Really? That’s so interesting. You know, I read your article with the atheist.7 I feel like you pushed back on him.

There are so many things in our lives, both on the small and the big scale, that we don’t understand. But I don’t think that means they’re beyond understanding. OK, you know what you would like? Because I know that you’re like, “I believe this,” but you seem to me very interested; you’re not just set in your ways. Have you ever heard that little story about two twins in a womb?8 I’m going to totally butcher it, but essentially it’s two twins who can talk in the womb. One twin is like, “I don’t think that there is any life after birth.” And the other is like, “I don’t know; I believe that there is something after we’re born.” “Well, no one’s ever come back after birth to tell us that there is.” “I think that there’s going to be a world where we can live without the umbilical cord and there’s light.” “What are you talking about? You’re crazy.” I think about it a lot. Do we just not have enough perspective here to see what could come next? I think you’ll like that story.

For the dying people who don’t experience what you describe — and especially their loved ones — is your book maybe setting them up to think, like: Did I do something wrong? Was my faith not strong enough? When I’m in the home, I will always prepare people for the worst-case scenario, which is that sometimes it looks like people might be close to going into a coma, and they haven’t seen anyone, and the family is extremely religious. I will talk to them and say, “In my own experience, only 30 percent of people can even communicate to us that they are seeing people.” So I try to be with my families and really prepare them for the worst-case scenario. But that is something I had to learn over time.

Have you thought about what a good death would be for you? I want to be at home. I want to have my immediate family come and go as they want, and I want a living funeral. I don’t want people to say, “This is my favorite memory of her,” when I’m gone. Come when I’m dying, and let’s talk about those memories together. There have been times when patients have shared with me that they just don’t think anyone cares about them. Then I’ll go to their funeral and listen to the most beautiful eulogies. I believe they can still hear it and are aware of it, but I’m also like, Gosh, I wish that before they died, they heard you say these things. That’s what I want.

You know, I have a really hard time with the supernatural aspects, but I think the work that you do is noble and valuable. There’s so much stuff we spend time thinking about and talking about that is less meaningful than what it means for those close to us to die. I have had so many people reach out to me who are just like you: “I don’t believe in the supernatural, but my grandfather went through this, and I appreciate getting more of an understanding. I feel like I’m not alone.” Even if they’re also like, “This is crazy,” people being able to feel not alone is valuable."
"Ozempic and Wegovy Don’t Cost What You Think They Do
Drug companies are making billions from a new class of in-demand weight-loss treatments. But the prices are not what they seem.

The problem is daunting: Powerful but expensive new drugs could help many of the 100 million American adults who have obesity and alleviate a grave public health concern.

But how can the nation afford lifelong treatments for so many people, with sticker prices for each patient ranging from about $900 to $1,300 every four weeks?

Some researchers, like Dr. Walter C. Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, have warned that the drugs could add 50 percent to the country’s health care spending.

“You can see this ballooning completely out of control,” he said.

But there is one factor often left out of these discussions: The drugs’ list prices are generally very different from the net prices, which companies receive after making secret deals with health insurers or the intermediaries known as pharmacy benefit managers. Companies generally do not reveal net prices, but there are data sources that can be used to estimate them.

A recent paper published by the American Enterprise Institute revealed that the net prices for the new obesity drugs are just a fraction of the published annual list prices.

And while the drugs’ prices remain out of reach for many, economists anticipate they will soon be driven down. More than a dozen companies are developing obesity drugs. As they enter the market, greater choice is expected to make prices plummet, as has happened with other expensive drugs.

“My prediction is that as competition increases, prices will decrease accordingly,” said Jalpa Doshi, professor of medicine and director of the economics evaluation unit at the University of Pennsylvania.

Strong Demand, Falling Prices?
For now, manufacturers are reaping the rewards of soaring demand.

Investors expect Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Wegovy, to earn $4 billion in revenue this year. The company’s other drug, Ozempic, is expected to bring in $11 billion. The drugs are driving such a bonanza that they account for almost all of the latest economic growth in Denmark, the home of Novo Nordisk.

Those revenues are based on the net prices.

For their analysis, Benedic N. Ippolito, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, and Joseph F. Levy, a health economist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, relied on data from SSR Health, which uses company financial filings and estimates of the number of prescriptions filled.

The economists derived net prices by using data from SSR Health for the second quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of 2023. The exception is Mounjaro, made by Eli Lilly, for which only data from the first quarter of 2023 was available.

Net prices, the revenue divided by the number of prescriptions in their analysis, appear to be around $700 every four weeks for Wegovy, or about $650 less than the list price; about $300 for Ozempic, or nearly $650 less than the list price; and approximately $215 for Mounjaro, or about $800 less than its list price.

A Close Look at Weight Loss Drugs
Teenage Obesity: Twenty-two percent of adolescents age 12 to 19 have obesity. But pediatricians are hesitant to prescribe medicines like Wegovy, citing their newness and uncertainties around them.
Menopausal Weight Gain: Some women going through menopause are seeking drugs like Ozempic to help with excess weight. Experts worry about the risks, but some doctors are beginning to oblige.
A Striking Benefit: A pivotal new study suggests that the weight loss drug Wegovy cut the risk of heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular issues by 20% among overweight or obese people with heart disease.
Reshaping Denmark’s Economy: Novo Nordisk, the Danish company behind Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug also used by some people for weight loss, is reaping huge profits and is now responsible for most of the country’s economic growth.
Side Effects: Diabetes treatments that are used to lose weight can reduce people’s desire to drink alcohol and their obsessive thinking about food. The drugs also carry serious risks, including malnutrition and facial aging.
That means Wegovy’s net price is about half of its list price, Ozempic’s is nearly two-thirds lower and Mounjaro’s net price is nearly 80 percent lower than its list price.

Dr. Ippolito cautioned that because prices and prescriptions are in flux, these figures might change over time, but added that “these estimates give a good sense for the likely amount paid by many insurers and give a good sense for the amount of discounting going on.”

Pragya Kakani, an economist at Weill Cornell Medical College, analyzed similar data with similar results but was not involved in Dr. Ippolito and Dr. Levy’s research.

Craig Garthwaite, a health care economist at Northwestern University, is especially intrigued by the net prices of Ozempic and Mounjaro. Both are approved for people with diabetes but also cause weight loss. Wegovy, the same drug as Ozempic, is approved for weight loss. But the price of Ozempic is substantially lower than Wegovy’s price.

The reason may be that Ozempic has a direct competitor in Mounjaro.

But even Wegovy, which so far has the market for the new obesity drugs to itself, has an unexpectedly low net price, Amitabh Chandra, a health care economist at Harvard, said.

“One might have naïvely thought that these are new medicines that are in great demand, so rebates would be small to nil,” Dr. Chandra said.

“I was shocked,” he said, “by the extent of the rebates.”

A Price We Already Pay
One question looms, experts say: What is weight loss worth to patients and society?

Obesity itself is expensive because it increases the risk for expensive diseases like diabetes and heart disease. One study found that obesity was associated with $1,861 excess yearly health costs per person, accounting for $172.74 billion in annual extra costs.

The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an influential nonprofit group, asked about a year ago if the new weight-loss drugs are cost-effective, meaning that their value in terms of a better quality of life, a longer life and benefit to society exceeds their cost.

Wegovy, the group reported, was not cost-effective. But the institute relied on an early and less precise estimate of the drug’s net price.

When shown Wegovy’s estimated net price in the A.E.I. research, the group’s chief medical officer, Dr. David M. Rind, said that if the calculations were correct, Wegovy was cost-effective but “still poses major budget challenges.”

Dr. Willett, of Harvard, added in an interview: “I don’t think anyone can predict exactly where this will go because competition may reduce prices, and the uptake is still not clear, but the potential cost could go way beyond anything we have seen.”

Still, the expectation is that with less obesity, there will be fewer expensive obesity-related health problems, including type 2 diabetes.

Not only can diabetes lead to kidney failure, blindness and amputations, it also doubles the risk for heart attacks and strokes.

Patients may also get relief from the extreme social stigma and, often, self-loathing that accompanies obesity.

Until recently, the idea that treating obesity would reduce obesity-related health risks was based on anecdotes and correlations, not cause and effect.

Then in August Novo Nordisk announced the results of a large study, showing that Wegovy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, hospitalizations for heart failure and heart disease deaths by 20 percent.

That outcome alters the picture, Dr. Garthwaite said.

Some insurers do not cover drugs like Wegovy and may view obesity medications as vanity drugs. In response, some patients are suing their insurers.

With a cardiovascular benefit, he said, that rationale for not covering the drugs is “out the window.”

Costs We Can’t All Afford
While the net prices of the drugs may be lower than expected, they remain too expensive for many potential patients.

Those on Medicare, for instance, have no insurance coverage for Wegovy because Medicare is prevented by law from covering weight-loss drugs. Few state Medicaid programs cover the drug.

And while Novo Nordisk says that 80 percent of private insurers cover Wegovy, the drug is not affordable for all insured patients.

Katherine Baicker, a health economist, provost at the University of Chicago and an Eli Lilly board member, said that cheaper health insurance includes co-pays and deductibles that often render Wegovy out of reach. Patients with low-premium plans offered through the Affordable Care Act would similarly be priced out.

Dr. Scott Ramsey, a health economist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, worries that poorer patients, who are uninsured or whose insurance requires high co-pays, will be looking on longingly as wealthier patients get the drugs.

“We spent 15 years talking about the soaring cost of obesity to the health care system,” Dr. Garthwaite, the Northwestern economist, added. But with a way to cut that cost in reach, he said the attitude of some insurers seems to be, “we don’t want you to come up with a fix that costs money.”

Waves and Peaks
Relief should be coming soon, health economists predict, with companies rushing to develop their own drugs. Competition may lead to lower prices.

That happened, for example, with drugs for hepatitis C. An effective cure for the liver disease initially cost as much as $84,000, leading to dire warnings that the cost would be comparable to “total spending in the United States on all drugs.”

The list price of the hepatitis C treatment plunged, as competitors entered the market. Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate with drug makers, had more leverage as companies competed. Net prices fell accordingly.

A similar scenario may play out with Wegovy, which “is riding the wave of not having any direct competition,” Dr. Doshi said. But that status will end soon.

A version of Mounjaro by Eli Lilly is expected to be approved this year for obesity — a potential opening for insurers to agree to cover Wegovy but not Mounjaro, for example, if Wegovy’s price were to be sufficiently reduced.

Dr. Ippolito added that with more than 70 obesity drugs in development, he expected that competition would only increase.

For now, although the price of the drugs is likely at its peak, Dr. Chandra, the Harvard health care economist, argued that it is imperative for access to the drugs to be increased, even if that imposes a cost to society.

The purpose of health insurance is not to save money, he said, but “to improve the quality of life, happiness and self-esteem.”"
"In Global Conflict Zones, Hospitals and Doctors Are No Longer Spared
Over the last two decades, medical facilities and staff have become casualties of war more frequently, in violation of international law.

The explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday was the latest in a growing series of violent incidents involving medical facilities in conflict zones, which together have taken an enormous toll on vital health care infrastructure and staff in violation of what was once a bedrock aspect of international law.

Over last two decades, as the principle of sparing health care workers and facilities has continually eroded, the most dangerous incidents have been carried out by state actors, said Michiel Hofman, who is an operational coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Sudan and a veteran of medical aid delivery in Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria.

Yet Article 18 of the First Geneva Convention, ratified by United Nations member states after World War II, says that civilian hospitals “may in no circumstances be the object of attack, but shall at all times be respected and protected by the parties to the conflict.”

Article 20 of the convention says that health care workers similarly must be protected by all sides.

“The willingness of states to push the boundaries of international humanitarian law seems to have accelerated,” Mr. Hofman said. “It’s the states that have explicitly signed the Geneva Conventions, and states usually have far greater military power and especially air power.”

In Ukraine, Russia has carried out more than 1,100 attacks on health care facilities and personnel since it began its invasion 21 months ago, a staggering number for so short a period, said Leonard Rubenstein, an expert in health and human rights at Johns Hopkins University.

Mr. Rubenstein chairs the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition, which is made up of more than three dozen human rights and humanitarian organizations working in conflict zones, tracking attacks on health care around the world.

Mr. Rubenstein said the pattern of Russian attacks showed that Moscow has in some cases intentionally targeted hospitals and in others indiscriminately attacked areas where hospitals were located; both are war crimes. “They’re unaccountable, with complete impunity,” he said. “And they don’t care.”

Neither Russian soldiers or commanders nor any other state or paramilitary actor that has attacked medical sites, with one exception, has ever faced prosecution by international bodies, he added: “There is wide agreement in the international community that attacks on health care are unacceptable — protection of health care is like motherhood and apple pie. But there’s no real commitment by governments to do what you need to do to stop it.”

He added: “There has been no accountability, instead complete impunity — no prosecution and political interference with U.N. entities that seek even mild condemnation of states responsible for attacks.”

The only time a deliberate attack on a hospital was ever referred for prosecution in an international court involved the war in Bosnia. The charge was one of seven against a Serbian military commander considered by the tribunal investigating war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.

The International Criminal Court, a tribunal set up by the United Nations 21 years ago to prosecute crimes against humanity, has never issued an indictment for an attack on medical personnel or infrastructure.

Attacks on medical facilities jeopardize health care not only for those injured by fighting, but also for all those with routine medical needs. On Thursday, Doctors Without Borders (also known as M.S.F., an abbreviation for its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières) withdrew a surgical team from a hospital in Sudan after military authorities blocked all delivery of supplies to the facility. The team had been providing lifesaving trauma surgeries and cesarean sections from one of the last functioning hospitals in the capital, Khartoum.

“It’s so painful, because of the moral distress of the medics,” Mr. Hofman said. They were unable to function without basic supplies, but also profoundly disturbed to cut off one of the last sources of care in a city where fighting has not let up since rival factions of the military government went to war in April.

In Ukraine, Russian attacks have destroyed 10 to 15 percent of medical facilities. The damage is even more far-reaching than it might seem, said Pavlo Kovtoniuk, a former deputy minister of health in Ukraine who now works with a think tank called the Ukrainian Health Center.

“Hospitals symbolize respect for civilian life, and when people see that disregarded they say, ‘We have to get out,’” he said. “We have a huge loss of human capital, with more than six million people now living outside the borders.”

Among those who remain, there is a growing population in need of rehabilitation and psychosocial support, from a steadily shrinking health system.

“This is not a situation of waging war according to the laws of war and the Geneva Convention — this is a completely different philosophy of war where civilian lives are disregarded entirely,” Mr. Kovtoniuk said.

He added: “We are revisiting the rules we thought were a given on regard for civilian life, and Russia has contributed to this feeling, ‘OK, we can do this. We can attack civilian infrastructure as a weapon of war.’”

Ukrainian officials are working with the International Criminal Court to compile evidence from the attacks, Mr. Kovtoniuk said. At least some top Russian officials must be indicted in order to re-establish the principle of protecting health care workers and facilities, he said. Russia has often either said that the facilities it hit were harboring Ukrainian fighters or dismissed the accusations as fake.

In Sudan, M.S.F. says that fatalities caused by neglected medical needs are as great as those caused by violent injuries. According to the World Health Organization, 70 percent of Sudan’s medical facilities are no longer functioning. More than seven million people are now internally displaced and face a cascade of disease outbreaks.

There are epidemics of cholera, malaria, dengue fever and measles in Sudan. The W.H.O. says measles and malnutrition have killed 1,200 children since the war began in April, and vaccine delivery is impossible in many parts of the country.

“Health care was terrible to begin with, and any specialized care we had was overwhelmingly centered in Khartoum and it’s no longer functioning,” said Dr. Yasir Yousif Elamin, president of the Sudanese American Physicians Association. “The places able to do cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, cancer care, dialysis — all of these are out of service now.”

People who need these services are scattering to areas far from the capital; patients who need dialysis three times a week are receiving it once in a 10-day stretch, while cancer patients might manage to find chemotherapy treatment every few months, he said.

The physicians’ association is tracking attacks on health care facilities in hopes of supporting eventual prosecution.

Last month, in the city of Wad Madani, Dr. Elamin met a 5-year-old child who had been shot in the abdomen in Khartoum. His mother had taken him hundreds of miles in search of help.

“Imagine you don’t have something as basic as this, for a boy hit accidentally,” Dr. Elamin said.

Researchers began tracking attacks on health care facilities in conflict zones in an organized fashion only in the early 2000s, so it is difficult to speak with much certainty about the trend, Mr. Rubenstein said.

But in an analysis of the figures for 2022, Safeguarding Health in Conflict said that the 1,989 incidents that were tabulated represented “by far the highest number” documented since the coalition began reporting a decade ago.

After Ukraine, which accounted for nearly half the incidents, the most-affected country was Myanmar. More than 800 health care workers have been arrested there since a military coup in 2021.

Between 2014 and 2016, there was a series of horrific bombings of medical facilities in Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen — including a U.S. airstrike on an M.S.F.-run trauma center in Kunduz, Afghanistan, in 2015 that killed 42 people. (The Pentagon called it “unintentional.”)

The violence prompted the U.N. Security Council to unanimously adopt a resolution calling for greater protection of health care workers and facilities in armed conflict, which brought “a bit of a breather,” Mr. Hofman said. Those kinds of airstrikes continued in Syria, however.

“But now with four major wars erupting in the last few years — Ethiopia, then Ukraine, Sudan, and now Gaza — we are at a peak again,” he said.

There have been more than 115 attacks on health care facilities and personnel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. Israel has warned 20 hospitals in the north of Gaza to evacuate their patients in anticipation of a ground invasion but Palestinian doctors say it is impossible to move them.

In 2009, a suicide bomber infiltrated a graduation ceremony for medical students in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, and killed three cabinet ministers who were in attendance, plus the dean of the medical school, a dozen students and two journalists.

In addition to the terrible loss of life, the International Committee of the Red Cross calculated that an indirect effect of those deaths was as many as 150,000 missed physician consultations per year, in a country where the medical system was already in tatters because of a decades-long civil war.

"To Combat the Opioid Epidemic, Cities Ponder Facilities for Drug Use
Philadelphia is again the focus of a national campaign to open — or restrict — sites where people use drugs under medical supervision.

Quetcy M. Lozada, a first-term Philadelphia City Council member, stood on a September evening near an elementary school just off Kensington Avenue, the epicenter of a sprawling fentanyl market in a city that saw a record 1,413 drug overdose deaths last year.

Just a block away, the street and sidewalks were dotted with used syringes and their discarded orange caps.

“Kids have to go through this every day,” Ms. Lozada said, her voice rising. Children “are so impacted that they don’t want to come to school.”

Public health experts have long endorsed a controversial strategy to blunt the opioid epidemic that has been sweeping cities like Philadelphia: supervised drug consumption sites, in which people are allowed to take illicit drugs under professional supervision.

The sites employ medical and social workers who guard against overdoses by supplying oxygen and naloxone, the overdose-reversing drug, and by distributing clean needles and other resources to opioid users. New York City has two sites, the only ones operating openly in the nation.

Safe drug consumption facilities have reversed thousands of overdoses in the United States and abroad, helping people who use potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl avoid the worst consequences of a volatile drug supply.

In the United States, the sites represent a novel form of “harm reduction,” which aims not to make drug users sober or abstinent but to prevent disease, overdose and death. President Biden is the first president to endorse the idea.

But critics argue that the sites encourage a culture of permissiveness around illegal drugs, formally sanctioning opioid use in neighborhoods already struggling with high overdose rates. And they say that the groups working to open the sites, however well intentioned, should not encroach on communities that might be hostile to the strategy.

Hours earlier, Ms. Lozada had shepherded a measure through City Council that restricted where drug consumption sites could operate in the city. The legislation, which passed 13-1, survived a veto from Mayor Jim Kenney, who supports opening the facilities.

Ms. Lozada and her allies have cast their effort not as a rejection of drug consumption sites per se, but as a way for Philadelphia residents to choose whether one may operate in their neighborhoods. Kensington Avenue, which sits in Ms. Lozada’s district, is seen as one of the most obvious locations for such a facility.

Ms. Lozada said that her constituents did not want to accept living around open drug use, that it discouraged the use of local libraries and parks and drove away local businesses. “People in the political world just became afraid of: What do we do? How do we do it? Let’s not do anything,” she said of the state of her neighborhood.

Ms. Lozada has another idea: She supports involuntary roundups of opioid users, using the courts to route them to treatment facilities, a strategy that some public health experts have said is punitive and unproductive.

As much as any city, Philadelphia showcases the seesawing tensions and legal battles around supervised drug use. The city encapsulates a broader struggle among state and federal health officials searching for new methods to curtail the roughly 110,000 annual fatal drug overdoses in the United States.

The sites operate in a legal gray area. A federal law passed in 1986 prohibits people from keeping property where controlled substances are ingested, a measure that defenders called the “crack house statute.”

Some cities and states have moved to open the facilities despite the risk of federal reprisals, as research has shown that supervised consumption sites in Canada, Australia and European countries have saved lives and led people to treatment.

Yet even liberal elected officials and communities, like those in Philadelphia, continue to question what they consider more lenient approaches to opioid use.

In May, Pennsylvania state senators passed legislation banning the sites. San Francisco is on track for a record number of overdose deaths this year, yet the city’s lone facility closed last December. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a prominent Democrat, has vetoed legislation that would have allowed some cities in the state to open them.

This summer the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan threatened the group operating the New York sites, saying they were running afoul of the law.

And in Washington, the Biden administration has taken steps to limit their use even after key officials signaled openness to the strategy. The Justice Department asked a judge in Philadelphia this summer to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Safehouse, a nonprofit group working to open a supervised drug use site in the city.

The Trump administration sued the organization in 2019, halting its plans. The Biden administration and Safehouse have yet to agree on a settlement. Ronda Goldfein, the group’s vice president, said a decision from a federal judge could come any day.

For groups with licenses to open sites, progress has been slow. After lawmakers in Rhode Island legalized drug consumption sites in 2021, the first state to do so, lease negotiations, construction delays and supply chain problems stalled the opening.

“There’s layers of bureaucracy,” said Colleen Daley Ndoye, executive director of Project Weber/RENEW, a group working to open the facility.

Fears have not been born out by research: Supervised consumption sites have not led to upticks in neighborhood crime or community drug use, studies have found. And they can save lives.

In New York, the group operating the two sites said in August that workers had reversed 1,000 overdoses since opening. In San Francisco, medical workers reversed over 300 overdoses in nearly a year at a drug consumption site in the city’s Tenderloin neighborhood.

Minnesota, the second state to legalize the sites after Rhode Island, plans to spend around $26 million on harm reduction services in the coming years, with some of the funds potentially going toward supervised consumption sites.

The state’s human services department is putting together potential plans to open the facilities, Jeremy Drucker, Minnesota’s director of addiction and recovery, said.

“People can’t recover if they’re dead,” he said.

In Philadelphia, the issue has captivated the city, pitting elected officials, residents and public health advocates against one another and exposing divisions in their approaches to the raging epidemic.

The Opioid Crisis
Fentanyl: The drug has become a leading cause of death in the United States, an issue on the presidential campaign trail and the subject of major diplomatic efforts by the Biden administration. Here is what to know.
Narcan: The first opioid overdose reversal medication approved for over-the-counter purchase will soon arrive in many stores. Here’s what to know about buying this lifesaving drug.
Consumption Sites: A controversial strategy to blunt the opioid epidemic that has been sweeping cities like Philadelphia: supervised drug consumption sites, in which people are allowed to take illicit drugs under professional supervision.
Beyond Opioids: Millions of drug users in the United States now are addicted to several substances, not just opioids. The shift is making treatment far more difficult.
The same has been true of state and congressional leaders. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a rising Democratic star, has long opposed the drug consumption sites, while Senator John Fetterman, a popular Democrat, has supported them.

But at the recent City Council meeting, there was just one vote against legislation restricting where the sites might be opened. “I know that this is a fight that I’m not going to win,” Kendra Brooks, a council member at large, said in an interview before the meeting.

“It can’t be a radical idea — providing folks who are in a medical crisis with the support they need to live,” she added.

Michael Driscoll, a City Council member who opposes the sites, said that even if drug consumption facility were to offer people temporary protection against overdosing, “as they drift to other parts of their lives and stay dependent on these bad drugs, we’re going to lose that life as a productive citizen.”

Mr. Kenney, the Philadelphia mayor, watched the vote from his office below the Council chambers in City Hall. “I was a little depressed,” he said in an interview after the meeting concluded.

“It’s not just the people on Kensington Avenue. It’s people in every neighborhood, their sons and daughters in the basement or in the bathroom. If they’re by themselves, how do you get them better?”

Mr. Kenney said that a site in Kensington would draw people from the street who have nowhere else to go, reducing drug-related litter and offering services far beyond the supervision of drug use.

He criticized City Council members for deferring to constituents who balked at the idea.

“If we put that standard on every public issue, our schools would still be segregated because people in the community, back in the day when we were desegregating schools, said no, and a court had to tell them to do it,” he said.

Treatment alone is not always the answer, some public health experts say. Some substance users are unwilling to take medication, or cycle in and out of treatment programs.

“If people aren’t ready, they aren’t ready,” said Susan Sherman, a drug policy expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has studied supervised drug consumption.

There are also major obstacles for anyone seeking treatment, including the resources available. One effective opioid addiction medication, methadone, is heavily regulated and often difficult to obtain. Another effective treatment, buprenorphine, is underprescribed.

A site in Philadelphia would likely offer services far beyond medical supervision of drug use. Workers could distribute fentanyl test strips and clean needles, direct drug users to treatment  once they are willing, and help them find housing or food. And staff could provide wound care, a vital service in a city besieged by xylazine, an addictive animal tranquilizer that causes horrific lesions.

“We walk around all day looking at folks who are in the street, who need services, who are overdosing, who are losing their kids,” Moses Santana, a supporter of supervised consumption sites, told Council members at City Hall.

“We have to look at these folks as if we’re looking at ourselves.”"
"How an ‘Effort-Reward Imbalance’ Can Make Work Miserable
Experts offer tips on what to do if you’re not getting the respect or compensation you deserve.

Life isn’t fair.

It’s a phrase so often repeated that it has become a cliché. But studies have shown that humans are hard-wired to want their fair share, as are other animals that have cooperative relationships, like monkeys, birds and wolves.

In one famous experiment, researchers trained two capuchin monkeys to hand them tokens in exchange for a cucumber snack. At first, the animals were happy with this arrangement — that is, until one of the monkeys received grapes instead, which are considered far more delicious. The other monkey, who continued to receive cucumbers, looked enraged, shook the walls of her enclosure and hurled the cucumbers out of reach.

She would rather have nothing, it seemed, than receive an inferior reward.

In the workplace, psychologists refer to this as effort-reward imbalance. The effort is the time, energy and emotional labor devoted to completing a task — and the rewards are what you get back from your workplace, such as compensation, benefits, recognition and opportunities.

In humans, the perception that you are getting less than others for the same amount of work can contribute to symptoms associated with burnout and lead to a higher risk of depression. The need for fairness is most likely a biological predisposition to avoid exploitation, explained Sarah Brosnan, a professor of psychology, philosophy and neuroscience at Georgia State University who co-led the capuchin study.

“We should care what we get relative to others,” she said. “We do best if we can work well with others, but it only benefits us if we’re working with someone who isn’t taking advantage of us.”

If you feel that your efforts in the workplace are not in line with your rewards, here are some steps that you can take to examine the situation and, hopefully, find more balance.

Get a reality check.
Equity theory, which was developed in the 1960s by a behavioral psychologist, says that in order to feel motivated, employees need to be convinced that the rewards they receive are fair and similar to those that their counterparts are getting.

But first ask yourself: Am I really being undervalued by my company, team or manager?

“You might have a different view of your skills and your marketability than others do,” said Ben Dattner, an organizational psychologist and executive coach in New York City.

If you are represented by a labor union, have a conversation with one of the leaders to get a better sense of how your compensation or other types of rewards compare to that of union members in similar roles. Consider also consulting with a career coach who can help you think through how to address potential inequities.

Think of it like a scale where effort is balanced with rewards, said Dennis Stolle, the senior director of applied psychology at the American Psychological Association.

Ponder the intangible rewards too — are you learning a lot, deriving meaning from your work or making useful connections? Do you have a great boss or flexible hours? Do you receive recognition for your efforts?

Sometimes the grass isn’t greener when you tally up those benefits.

Take action.
Once you identify your priorities, think: “What can I constructively do about this?” Dr. Dattner said.

Have a direct conversation with your manager about your goals, Dr. Stolle said. Are they realistic? Are they in line with what the company needs and wants? During the conversation, be as concrete as possible about what you want, he advised.

If you are looking for more compensation, take an objective look at the value you are adding to the company. This type of information will help your manager advocate on your behalf, Dr. Dattner said.

Dr. Stolle noted that when it comes to the less tangible rewards, like the opportunity to advance, “there’s more room for miscommunication and hurt feelings.”

He gave the hypothetical example of a young woman starting out in the marketing profession who wants to eventually be asked to attend client meetings. Her supervisor, however, is not aware she expects this to happen in her first year on the job. Having a conversation about her goals allows them to set a more concrete and realistic timeline.

Stop overcommitting.
Some people have difficulty stepping away from work, especially when technology enables us to stay continuously connected.

But this can lead to what psychologists call overcommitment, where people pour themselves into their work, even when the rewards do not justify that level of effort.

Overcommitment paired with low rewards can make workers especially vulnerable to emotional exhaustion, which is one of the signs of burnout, Dr. Stolle said.

“When you reach emotional exhaustion, you’re just too tired to control your emotions anymore,” which can lead to tears or outbursts, Dr. Stolle said.

If you have made your best effort and are still not being treated fairly, “you don’t have to live like that,” he added. “There are surely other opportunities. It may not happen tomorrow, but you can start looking.”"
"David Shaffer, Medical ‘Detective’ in Suicide of Youths, Dies at 87
At a time when teen suicide was seen as random and unpredictable, Dr. Shaffer, a psychiatrist, led investigations that proved that it was not.

Dr. David Shaffer, a psychiatrist who spent decades studying children and teenagers who died by suicide, constructing a framework for screening and laying the groundwork for modern prevention efforts, died on Sunday in Mastic Beach, N.Y., on Long Island. He was 87.

His son, Dr. Charlie Shaffer, said the cause was respiratory complications  of Alzheimer’s disease. For about six years, as the disease progressed, he had lived on the estate of the Vogue editor Anna Wintour, his former wife and the mother of two of his children.

In the 1970s, when Dr. Shaffer was a young doctor, most people saw the suicide of a child or adolescent as a random and unpredictable act. Trained as an epidemiologist, he undertook an investigation known as a “psychological autopsy,” gathering detailed information from adult caregivers of 31 children who had died by suicide.

The research yielded surprises. In more than a third of the cases, the suicide had occurred in the midst of what he called a “disciplinary crisis,” as the child awaited consequences. Many of the children were described, not as depressed, but as aggressive or impulsive.

And there were clusters of suicides apparently driven by contagion. Dr. Shaffer realized this when he repeatedly spotted the name of one Welsh town in coroners’ reports, a light-bulb moment that he recalled with satisfaction many years later.

“He liked the detective work,” Dr. Charlie Shaffer said. “That’s why he loved being an epidemiologist. He loved detective stories.”

That investigation, and the others that Dr. Shaffer conducted in the years that followed, have helped identify clinical, neurological and behavioral characteristics linked to suicide.

As the head of Columbia University’s vast and influential child psychiatry program, he developed clinical tools that are widely used today, such as the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, or DISC-IV, an interview that assesses more than 30 common diagnoses.

The prevention and screening programs that he championed decades ago are now commonplace. Looking back on his career in 2004, in Focus, the American Psychiatric Association’s clinical review journal, he recalled that, in his youth, society had regarded suicide as “a reasoned choice for those facing harsh circumstances” that “defied prediction and prevention.”

The work of epidemiologists and social and cognitive psychologists had proved that most people who died by suicide had an untreated mental illness. “Once the province of the author, poet, and philosopher, suicide is now squarely in clinical territory,” Dr. Shaffer added.

Colleagues recalled him as an insatiable researcher, seeking out the families of young people who had died by suicide and trying to learn everything about them, in hopes of eventually finding ways to interrupt a chain of events that can lead to suicide.

“He was fascinated by how people behaved, and why they behaved that way,” said Prudence Fisher, a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan who often accompanied him on these visits.

The interviews often lasted four to six hours, she said, and the researchers were frequently the first people the families had spoken to about their child’s death; they “welcomed someone coming in to ask these questions,” Dr. Fisher added.

Dr. Daniel Pine, who worked under Dr. Shaffer’s supervision at Columbia for 10 years, said Dr. Shaffer was “really drawn to the tragedy of it all.”

“He was this really passionate guy, and tragedy wouldn’t make him necessarily turn away where other people might,” said Dr. Pine, the chief of the emotion and development branch at the National Institute of Mental Health. “They talk about people who run toward the danger — David was that kind of guy.”

David Shaffer was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, on April 20, 1936, to Joyce and Isaac Shaffer. His father, an immigrant born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, was a wealthy businessman who oversaw factories for multinational corporations.

As a child, David was repelled by South Africa’s apartheid system, and when he left for boarding school in Switzerland as a teenager, he was drawn to left-wing causes, his son said. At one point, he was caught smuggling socialist pamphlets home to distribute to workers in his father’s factory.

That rebellion was interrupted by the death of his father in a plane crash when David was 16.

He felt at home in London, where he trained at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and the Maudsley Hospital. He had an “English eccentricity and values to life,” Ms. Wintour said, hosting a revolving cast of houseguests and gathering large groups for elaborate meals, only to vanish as they sat down because he thought of something else he wanted to serve.

“He was supremely eccentric,” Ms. Wintour said. “He didn’t follow the traditional rules of life in any way.”

In England, he began working with Dr. Michael Rutter, who pioneered child psychiatry as a specialty. He viewed suicide as an untapped opportunity, an area where “people were not doing science, and he thought they should be and they could be,” his son said.

When he relocated to the United States, in the 1970s, American psychiatry was dominated by the psychoanalytic model, in stark contrast to his own data-driven approach. Each new research finding on suicide “reinforced his desire to sort of push back against the psychoanalysts’ grip on psychiatry at the time,” his son said.

Mr. Shaffer’s first marriage, to society caterer Serena Millington, ended in divorce in 1983. His marriage to Ms. Wintour ended in divorce in 1999.

Both marriages situated him at the edge of high-octane New York glamour not typical of academic psychiatrists. Colleagues recall that he and Ms. Wintour would buy multiple tables at galas supporting mental health causes, and that extra seats were filled with models.

He traveled widely and unpredictably. “You know, he took us to Libya for Christmas,” said his daughter, Bee Carrozzini.

In addition to her and his son Charlie, both from his marriage to Ms. Wintour, Dr. Shaffer is survived by two sons from his first marriage, Joe and Sam, and seven grandchildren.

Dr. Shaffer was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2015. In 2017, Ms. Wintour invited him to live full-time on her property in Mastic. “He was never good at arguing with me,” she said.

At first, they played dominoes and read together, she said, but “toward the end, it was, you know, holding his hand and eating with him, and feeding him.”

He had been living there for more than a year when his daughter was married at the house. Ms. Carrozzini recalled her friends’ wonder at the arrangement: “They turned to me and said, ‘That is the purest form of love, the way that your mom was taking care of your dad.’”"
"If You’ve Ever Heard a Voice That Wasn’t There, This Could Be Why
With a ghostly finger in a lab, researchers coaxed people to hear phantom voices.

Some years ago, scientists in Switzerland found a way to make people hallucinate. They didn’t use LSD or sensory deprivation chambers. Instead, they sat people in a chair and asked them to push a button that, a fraction of a second later, caused a rod to gently press their back. After a few rounds, the volunteers got the creeping sense of someone behind them. Faced with a disconnect between their actions and their sensations, their minds conjured another explanation: a separate presence in the room.

In a new study published in the journal Psychological Medicine, researchers from the same lab used the ghostly finger setup to probe another kind of hallucination: hearing voices. They found that volunteers were more likely to report hearing a voice when there was a lag between the push of the button and the rod’s touch than when there was no delay.

The findings suggest that the neurological roots of hallucinations lie in how the brain processes contradictory signals from the environment, the researchers said.

Hearing voices is more common than you might think, said Pavo Orepic, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Geneva and an author of the new paper. In surveys, scientists have discovered that many people without a psychiatric diagnosis — perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the general population — report having heard a disembodied voice at some point in their lives.

“There is actually a continuum of these experiences,” Dr. Orepic said. “So all of us hallucinate — at certain times, like if you’re tired, you’ll hallucinate more, for instance — and some people are more prone to do so.”

In the new study, as in earlier work, Dr. Orepic and his collaborators had volunteers sit in a chair and push the button that caused the rod to touch their backs. During some sessions, there was no delay between the push and the touch, while others had a half-second delay — enough time to give volunteers that feeling that someone was nearby.

During all trials, the volunteers listened to recordings of pink noise, a softer version of white noise. Some recordings contained recorded bits of their own voice, while others had fragments of someone else’s voice or no voice at all. In each trial, the volunteers were asked if they had heard anyone speaking.

The study found that when people were already experiencing the peculiar feeling of a ghostly presence, they were more likely to say they had heard a voice when there was none. What’s more, hearing a nonexistent voice was more likely if, earlier in the experiment, they had heard bursts of noise with someone else’s voice in them.

That suggests the brain was linking the hallucinated presence and the voice, Dr. Orepic said.

Intriguingly, volunteers with no lag between the button-pressing and the rod sometimes reported hearing a nonexistent voice as well, and they were more likely to do so if they had recently been hearing clips of their own voice. If volunteers unconsciously decided they were responsible for the feeling of the finger on their backs, they may have been primed to hear their own voice, the researchers said.

Together, the findings support the idea that hallucinations may arise from difficulty in recognizing one’s own actions, as well as being primed to expect a particular outcome, Dr. Orepic said. As time went on, people experiencing a ghostly presence in the trial were increasingly likely to hear voices, implying that the brain was somehow drawing on past experience to build up the impression of someone speaking.

Delving more into how the brain builds the impression of a voice when none is there, Dr. Orepic said, may rely on help from healthy people who regularly hear voices — for instance, mediums who feel they can communicate with the dead. He points to ongoing studies at Yale with such people who hear voices as a pathway to understanding how these beliefs arise and how they may be controlled. For mediums, hearing voices is not necessarily unwelcome. But perhaps, with their aid, people whose hallucinations are distressing and disruptive may find some peace."
"Roland Griffiths Is Dead at 77; Led a Renaissance in Psychedelics Research
The drugs had been the third rail of scientific inquiry. But in a landmark study, he saw them as a legitimate way to help alleviate suffering and even to reach a mystical state.

Roland Griffiths, a professor of behavioral science and psychiatry whose pioneering work in the study of psychedelics helped usher in a new era of research into those once banned substances — and reintroduced the mystical into scientific discourse about them — died on Monday at his home in Baltimore. He was 77.

The cause was colon cancer, said Claudia Turnbull, a longtime friend.

Dr. Griffiths, a distinguished psychopharmacologist and professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, spent decades studying the mechanisms of dependence on mood-altering drugs. He published scores of papers on opiates and cocaine, on sedatives and alcohol, on nicotine and caffeine.

His work on caffeine, which he noted was the most commonly used drug in the world, was groundbreaking, showing that, yes, it was addictive, that withdrawal could be painful and that caffeine dependence was a “clinically meaningful disorder.”

But in August 2006 he published a paper that wasn’t just groundbreaking; it was mind-blowing.

The paper had an unusual title: “Psilocybin Can Occasion Mystical-Type Experiences Having Substantial and Sustained Personal Meaning and Spiritual Significance.” And when it appeared in the magazine Psychopharmacology, it caused a media ruckus.

“The God Pill,” read the headline in The Economist. Here was the first double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in decades to examine the psychological effects of a psychedelic on what scientists call “healthy normals” — healthy volunteers. Its focus was not on the beneficial properties of the drug for those suffering from depression, or being treated for cancer, or facing end-of-life terrors, or trying to quit smoking. Those landmark studies would come later.

This work involved trained doctors administering high doses of psilocybin — the psychoactive, or mind-altering, component found in the psilocybe genus of mushrooms — to healthy people in a controlled, living room-like setting.

Eighty percent of the participants described the experience as among the most revelatory and spiritually meaningful episodes of their lives, akin to the death of a parent or the birth of a child, as Dr. Griffiths often said.

Their experience had all the attributes of a mystical event. They described profound feelings of joy, love and, yes, terror, along with a sense of interconnectedness and even an understanding of a sublime, sacred and ultimate reality.

Such positive effects on their mood and behavior lasted for months and even years, as the author Michael Pollan discovered when he interviewed many of the participants for his 2018 book, “How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression and Transcendence.”

“To listen to these people describe the changes in their lives inspired by their psilocybin journeys is to wonder if the Hopkins session room isn’t a kind of human transformation factory,” Mr. Pollan wrote.

But Dr. Griffiths’s work showed that researchers could do more than induce a mystical experience in a lab; they could also use the tools of science — brain imaging, for example — to prospectively, as he put it, examine the nature of consciousness and of religious experience.

As Charles Schuster, a former director of the government’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, told The New York Times in 2006, “This represents a landmark study, because it is applying modern techniques to an area of human experience that goes back as long as humankind has been here.”

In a phone interview, Mr. Pollan said, “Roland had such a sterling reputation as being a rigorous and conscientious scientist.”

“No one of his stature had stepped into this area in such a long time that it gave a lot of other people confidence,” he added. “When he presented this completely weird study, which was so out there for science, it could have been dumped on, but it wasn’t.”

Dr. Griffiths’s work, which began in 1999, was endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration as well as a cohort of experts that included the former deputy of the drug czar under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. And it ushered in what many have called a renaissance in psychedelic research.

“The fact that psychedelic research was being done at Hopkins — considered the premier medical center in the country — made it easier to get it approved here,” said Anthony P. Bossis, a psychologist specializing in palliative care at New York University.

He told Mr. Pollan that Dr. Griffiths’s work had paved the way for him and his colleagues to begin using psilocybin to successfully treat anxiety in cancer patients.

Theirs was not the only institution to do so. Similar research involving cancer patients, alcoholics, smokers and sufferers of depression began in earnest in this country and overseas following the publication of Dr. Griffiths’s paper.

“It was an amazing study,” Dr. Bossis told Mr. Pollan, “with such an elegant design. And it opened up the field.”

Psychedelics had been the third rail of scientific inquiry ever since Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert were thrown out of Harvard for passing out LSD with messianic fervor in the early 1960s. By the end of that decade, psychedelics had been declared controlled substances deemed illegal for recreational and medical use.

Yet beginning in the 1950s, well before Dr. Leary exhorted a generation to “turn on, tune in and drop out,” LSD — a synthetic chemical derived from a fungus, along with psilocybin and other psychedelics — were being studied and used successfully to treat alcoholism, depression, anxiety and distress among the terminally ill.

The term psychedelic was coined in 1956 and drawn from the Greek root psyche, which translates to mind or soul. Freighted with the counterculture baggage of the 1960s, however, it devolved from its original meaning as a mind-altering drug into an aesthetic rendered in loopy typefaces and black-light posters.

Dr. Griffiths was well-suited to bring psychedelics back as a legitimate area of scientific inquiry. Like many students of psychology of his generation, he had been heavily influenced by the work of B.F. Skinner, the “radical behaviorist” who disdained the focus on emotions and the unconscious that had long dominated the field and rather dwelled on the role of environment in determining, or conditioning, human behavior.

In 1994, Dr. Griffiths began meditating regularly, which led to a transformative experience that, he said, “profoundly shifted my worldview and got me very curious about the nature of spiritual experiences.”

He told Mr. Pollan that the experience was so profound that he nearly quit science to devote himself to a spiritual practice. But, as it happened, others were working to rehabilitate the study of psychedelics. One was Bob Jesse, a former vice president of the software company Oracle, who had established a nonprofit to encourage research on mystical experiences and whose introduction to Dr. Griffiths became the engine for what would soon change the direction of Dr. Griffiths’s research and reinvigorate the field.

As researchers in his lab and elsewhere were studying the use of psilocybin in treating cancer patients, smokers and those with depression, he began focusing on examining the mystical aspects of their experiences and plumbing the nature of consciousness. He came to believe that the insights gleaned from psilocybin could have profound effects on humanity, which he saw heading toward disaster.

Psychedelics, he suggested, might right the ship.

“A hallmark feature of these experiences is that we’re all in this together,” he told The Chronicle of Higher Education in April. “It opens people up to this sense that we have a commonality and that we need to take care of each other.”

Roland Redmond Griffiths was born on July 19, 1946, in Glen Cove, N.Y., to William and Sylvie (Redmond) Griffiths. His father, who had trained as a psychologist, specialized in public health; his mother was a homemaker until the family moved to El Cerrito, Calif., in about 1951, after William had taken a job as a professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley. There, Sylvie began successfully pursuing a master’s in psychology.

Roland majored in psychology at Occidental College in Los Angeles and studied psychopharmacology at the University of Minnesota, earning his Ph.D. there in 1972. Johns Hopkins hired him immediately afterward, and he began concentrating his research on drug use and addiction.

Dr. Griffiths is survived by his wife, Marla Weiner; his three children, Sylvie Grahan, Jennie Otis and Morgan Griffiths; five grandchildren; and his siblings, Kathy Farley and Mark Griffiths. His marriage in 1973 to Kristin Ann Johnson ended in divorce, as did his marriage to Diana Hansen.

Dr. Griffiths was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer in November 2021, a finding he came to embrace, as he told David Marchese of The New York Times Magazine. He convinced Johns Hopkins to establish an endowed professorship in his name for research on the effects of psychedelics on spirituality and well-being. At his death, he was completing a paper about a study he had conducted in which clergy from a wide range of faiths received a high dose of psilocybin to see how it would affect their life and work.

Notably, his laboratory’s first therapeutic study with psilocybin was with cancer patients, but Dr. Griffiths said he waited a bit before using a psychedelic to investigate his own condition. When he did — he took LSD — he approached the session like a reporter, and queried his cancer: What are you doing here? Is this going to kill me?

“The answer was,” he told Mr. Marchese, “‘Yes, you will die, but everything is absolutely perfect; there’s meaning and purpose to this that goes beyond your understanding, but how you’re managing that is exactly how you should manage it.’”

Long before his cancer diagnosis, Dr. Griffiths told Mr. Pollan that he hoped his own death would not be sudden, that he would have time to savor it. “Western materialism says the switch gets turned off and that’s it,” he said. “But there are so many other descriptions. It could be a beginning! Wouldn’t that be amazing.”"
"F.D.A. Plans to Ban Hair Straighteners With Formaldehyde
The products, often marketed to Black women, have been linked to an increased risk of uterine cancer.

The Food and Drug Administration has proposed banning hair-straightening products that contain or emit formaldehyde, more than a decade after the cosmetic industry’s own experts declared the products unsafe.

Frequent use of chemical hair straighteners has been linked to a possible increase in the risk of developing cancer of the uterus, which is also called endometrial cancer. Women who use the products often face more than twice the risk of those who do not.

Other studies have linked hair straighteners and dyes to breast and ovarian cancer. The agency’s scientists deemed formaldehyde to be a human carcinogen seven years ago, and its lawyers started drafting a proposed ban then.

Workers like embalmers who are exposed to high levels of formaldehyde have higher rates of myeloid leukemia and other rare cancers. The F.D.A. warns that immediate reactions can include irritation of the eyes and throat, coughing, wheezing or chest pain. Chronic or long-term problems include frequent headaches, asthma, skin irritation and allergic reactions.

The hair-straightening products are marketed largely to Black women. While rates of uterine cancer have been rising among all women in recent years, the increase has been steepest among women of color, including Asian and Hispanic women.

The agency’s proposed rule would ban formaldehyde and other formaldehyde-releasing chemicals from hair-straightening and hair-smoothing products marketed in the United States. The target date for the ban is April 2024.

Some treatments, including so-called keratin treatments, claim to be formaldehyde-free but contain a substance called methylene glycol, which converts to formaldehyde gas after coming in contact with air. (Scientists consider methylene glycol simply to be formaldehyde in a solution.)

The F.D.A. has always had the authority to ban a specific ingredient like formaldehyde, and it has removed about a dozen ingredients, including mercury compounds, from cosmetics.

But the industry went largely unregulated until last year, when Congress gave the F.D.A. oversight authority. The action was not related to the new authority, however, the F.D.A. said.

The expanded oversight does not mean that new products will typically undergo agency review before they are marketed to the public. But manufacturers of shampoo, nail polish, makeup and other items are now required to register their manufacturing sites with the F.D.A., and they are required to disclose the ingredients on the packaging.

The F.D.A. can also issue a mandatory recall of a cosmetic product if a serious health concern arises or a death occurs.

Controversy over formaldehyde in hair straighteners has persisted for years. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization, petitioned the agency in 2011 and again in 2021 to ban hair products with formaldehyde.

F.D.A. lawyers started drafting rules for a proposed ban in 2016. But the process halted abruptly a few months later, and no explanation was given.

“The F.D.A. has known for decades now that these products are dangerous,’’ said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. “There is no reason for them not to have acted sooner.”

“This is the first public indication we’ve seen that they are planning to ban it in hair-straightening products,” Ms. Benesh added. The products pose a real risk of harm, she said, both to hair stylists regularly exposed to formaldehyde vapor while providing the treatment, as well as to customers receiving it.

The agency currently encourages consumers to read the labels of hair products before purchasing them and to avoid those that contain formaldehyde, formalin or methylene glycol. The agency urges consumers to ask hairdressers what products they are using and to report adverse reactions."
"Scientists Offer a New Explanation for Long Covid

A team of scientists is proposing a new explanation for some cases of long Covid, based on their findings that serotonin levels were lower in people with the complex condition.

In their study, published on Monday in the journal Cell, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania suggest that serotonin reduction is triggered by remnants of the virus lingering in the gut. Depleted serotonin could especially explain memory problems and some neurological and cognitive symptoms of long Covid, they say.

Why It Matters: New ways to diagnose and treat long Covid.
This is one of several new studies documenting distinct biological changes in the bodies of people with long Covid — offering important discoveries for a condition that takes many forms and often does not register on standard diagnostic tools like X-rays.

The research could point the way toward possible treatments, including medications that boost serotonin. And the authors said the biological pathway that their research outlines could unite many of the major theories of what causes long Covid: lingering remnants of the virus, inflammation, increased blood clotting and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.

“All these different hypotheses might be connected through the serotonin pathway,” said Christoph Thaiss, a lead author of the study and an assistant professor of microbiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

“Second of all, even if not everybody experiences difficulties in the serotonin pathway, at least a subset might respond to therapies that activate this pathway,” he said.

“This is an excellent study that identifies lower levels of circulating serotonin as a mechanism for long Covid,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. Her team and colleagues at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai recently published a study that identified other biological changes linked to some cases of long Covid, including levels of the hormone cortisol. These studies could point to specific subtypes of long Covid or different biological indicators at different points in the condition.

The Back Story: A series of disruptions set off by bits of virus in the gut.
Researchers analyzed the blood of 58 patients who had been experiencing long Covid for between three months and 22 months since their infection. Those results were compared to blood analysis of 30 people with no post-Covid symptoms and 60 patients who were in the early, acute stage of coronavirus infection.

Maayan Levy, a lead author and assistant professor of microbiology at the Perelman School of Medicine, said levels of serotonin and other metabolites were altered right after a coronavirus infection, something that also happens immediately after other viral infections.

But in people with long Covid, serotonin was the only significant molecule that did not recover to pre-infection levels, she said.

The team analyzed stool samples from some of the long Covid patients and found that they contained remaining viral particles. Putting the findings in patients together with research on mice and miniature models of the human gut, where most serotonin is produced, the team identified a pathway that could underlie some cases of long Covid.

Here’s the idea: Viral remnants prompt the immune system to produce infection-fighting proteins called interferons. Interferons cause inflammation that reduces the body’s ability to absorb tryptophan, an amino acid that helps produce serotonin in the gut. Blood clots that can form after a coronavirus infection may impair the body’s ability to circulate serotonin.

Depleted serotonin disrupts the vagus nerve system, which transmits signals between the body and the brain, the researchers said. Serotonin plays a role in short-term memory, and the researchers proposed that depleted serotonin could lead to memory problems and other cognitive issues that many people with long Covid experience.

“They showed that one-two-three punch to the serotonin pathway then leads to vagal nerve dysfunction and memory impairment,” Dr. Iwasaki said.

There are caveats. The study was not large, so the findings need to be confirmed with other research. Participants in some other long Covid studies, in which some patients had milder symptoms, did not always show depleted serotonin, a result that Dr. Levy said might indicate that depletion happened only in people whose long Covid involves multiple serious symptoms.

What’s Next: A clinical trial of Prozac.
Scientists want to find biomarkers for long Covid — biological changes that can be measured to help diagnose the condition. Dr. Thaiss said the new study suggested three: the presence of viral remnants in stool, low serotonin and high levels of interferons.

Most experts believe that there will not be a single biomarker for the condition, but that several indicators will emerge and might vary, based on the type of symptoms and other factors.

There is tremendous need for effective ways to treat long Covid, and clinical trials of several treatments are underway. Dr. Levy and Dr. Thaiss said they would be starting a clinical trial to test fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor often marketed as Prozac, and possibly also tryptophan.

“If we supplement serotonin or prevent the degradation of serotonin, maybe we can restore some of the vagal signals and improve memory and cognition and so on,” Dr. Levy said."
"Harvard Cozies Up to #MentalHealth TikTok
As young Americans turn to TikTok for information on mental health, the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard is building its own team of influencers.

One day in February, an invitation from Harvard University arrived in the inbox of Rachel Havekost, a TikTok mental health influencer and part-time bartender in Seattle who likes to joke that her main qualification is 19 years of therapy.

The same email arrived for Trey Tucker, a.k.a. @ruggedcounseling, a therapist from Chattanooga, Tenn., who discusses attachment styles on his TikTok account, sometimes while loading bales of hay onto the bed of a pickup truck.

The invitations also made their way to Bryce Spencer-Jones, who talks his viewers through breakups while gazing tenderly into the camera, and to Kate Speer, who narrates her bouts of depression with wry humor, confiding that she has not brushed her teeth for days.

Twenty-five recipients glanced over the emails, which invited them to collaborate with social scientists at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard. They were not accustomed to being treated with respect by academia; several concluded that the letters were pranks or phishing attempts and deleted them.

They did not know — how could they? — that a team of researchers had been observing them for weeks, winnowing down an army of mental health influencers into a few dozen heavyweights selected for their reach and quality.

The surgeon general has described the mental health of young people in America as “the defining public health crisis of our time.” For this vulnerable, hard-to-reach population, social media serves as a primary source of information. And so, for a few months this spring, the influencers became part of a field experiment, in which social scientists attempted to inject evidence-based content into their feeds.

“People are looking for information, and the things that they are watching are TikTok and Instagram and YouTube,” said Amanda Yarnell, senior director of the Chan School’s Center for Health Communication. “Who are the media gatekeepers in those areas? Those are these creators. So we were looking at, how do we map onto that new reality?”

The answer to that question became clear in August, when a van carrying a dozen influencers pulled up beside the campus of Harvard Medical School. Everything about the space, its Ionic columns and Latin mottos carved in granite, told the visitors that they had arrived at the high temple of the medical establishment.

Each of the visitors resembled their audience: tattooed, in baseball caps or cowboy boots or chunky earrings that spelled the word LOVE. Some were psychologists or psychiatrists whose TikToks were a side gig. Others had built franchises by talking frankly about their own experiences with mental illness, describing eating disorders, selective mutism and suicide attempts.

On the velvety Quad of the medical school, they looked like tourists or day-trippers. But together, across platforms, they commanded an audience of 10 million users.

Step 1: The subjects

Samantha Chung, 30, who posts under the handle @simplifying.sam, could never explain to her mother what she did for a living.

She is not a mental health clinician — until recently, she worked as a real estate agent. But two years ago, a TikTok video she made on “manifesting,” or using the mind to bring about desired change, attracted so much attention that she realized she could charge money for one-on-one coaching, and quit her day job.

At first, Ms. Chung booked one-hour appointments for $90, but demand remained so high that she now offers counseling in three- and six-month “containers.” She sees no need to go to graduate school or get a license; her approach, as she puts it, “helps clients feel empowered rather than diagnosed.” She has a podcast, a book project and 813,000 followers on TikTok.

This accomplishment, however, meant little to her parents, immigrants from Korea who had hoped she would become a doctor. “I really just thought of myself as someone who makes videos in their apartment,” Ms. Chung said.

The work of an influencer can be isolating and draining, far from the sunlit glamour that many imagine. Ms. Havekost, 34, was struggling with whether she could even continue. After years of battling an eating disorder, the subject of her recent book, she was feeling stable, which did not generate mental health content; that was one problem.

The other problem was money. She is fastidious about endorsement deals, and still has to tend bar part time to make ends meet. “I’ve turned down an ice cream brand that wanted to pay me a lot of money to post a TikTok saying it was low sugar,” Ms. Havekost said. “That sucked, because I had to turn down my rent.”

At Harvard, the influencers were treated like dignitaries, provided with branded merchandise and buffet lunches as they listened to lectures on air quality and health communication. From time to time, the lecturers broke into jargon, referring to multivariate regression models and the Bronfenbrenner model of behavior theory.

During a break, Jaime Mahler, a licensed counselor from New York, remarked on this. In her videos, she prides herself on distilling complex clinical ideas into digestible nuggets. In this respect, she said, Harvard could learn a lot from TikTok.

“She kept using the word ‘heuristics,’ and that was actually a genuine distraction for me,” Ms. Mahler said of one lecturer. “I remembered her telling me what it was in the beginning, and I didn’t want to Google it, and I kept getting distracted. I was like, Oh, she used it again.”

But the main thing the guests wanted to express was gratitude. “I spent my 20s in a psychiatric ward trying to graduate from college,” said Ms. Speer, 36. “Walking into these rooms at Harvard and being held lovingly — honestly, it is nothing more than miraculous.”

Ms. Chung was so inspired that she told the assembled crowd that she would now post as an activist. “I am walking out of this knowing the truth, which is that I am a public health leader,” she said. When Meng Meng Xu, one of the researchers on the Harvard team, heard that, she got goose bumps. This was exactly what she had been hoping for.

Step 2: The field experiment

Many academics take a dim view of mental health TikTok, viewing it as a Wild West of unscientific advice and overgeneralization. Social media, researchers have found, often undermines established medical guidelines, warning viewers off evidence-based treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants, while boosting interest in risky, untested approaches like semen retention.

TikTok, which has grappled with how to moderate such content, said recently that it would direct users searching for a range of conditions like depression or anxiety to information from the National Institute of Mental Health and the Cleveland Clinic.

At their worst, researchers said, social media feeds can serve as a dark echo chamber, barraging vulnerable young people with messages about self-harm or eating disorders.

“Your heart just sinks,” said Corey H. Basch, a professor of public health from William Paterson University who led a 2022 study analyzing 100 TikTok videos with the hashtag #mentalhealth.

“If you’re feeling low and you have a dismal outlook, and for some reason that’s what you are drawn to, you will go down this rabbit hole,” she said. “And you could just sit there for hours watching videos of people who just want to die.”

Ms. Basch doubted that content creators could prove to be useful partners for public health. “Influencers are in the business of making money for their content,” she said.

Ms. Yarnell does not share this opinion. A chemist who pivoted to journalism, she found TikTok “a rich and exciting place” for scientists. She views influencers — she prefers the more respectful term “creators” — not as click-hungry amateurs but as independent media companies, making careful choices about partnerships and, at times, being motivated by altruism.

In addition, she said, they are good at what they do. “They understand what their audience needs,” Ms. Yarnell said. “They’ve done a huge amount of storytelling that has allowed stigma to fall away. They have been a huge part of convincing people to talk about different mental health concerns. They are a perfect translation partner.”

This is not the first time that Harvard’s public health experts have tried to hitch a ride with popular culture. In 1988, as part of a campaign to prevent traffic fatalities, researchers asked writers for prime-time television programs like “Cheers” and “L.A. Law” to write in references to “designated drivers,” a concept that was, at the time, entirely new to Americans. That effort was famously successful; by 1991, the phrase was so common that it appeared in Webster’s dictionary.

Inspired by this effort, Ms. Yarnell designed an experiment to determine whether influencers could be persuaded to disseminate more evidence-based information. First, her team developed a pool of 105 influencers who were both prominent and responsible: no diet-pill endorsements, no “five signs you have A.D.H.D.”

The influencers would not be paid but, ideally, would be won over to the cause. Forty-two of them agreed to be part of the study and received digital tool kits organized into five “core themes”: difficulty accessing care, intergenerational trauma, mind-body links, the effect of racism on mental health and climate anxiety.

A smaller group of 25 influencers also received lavish, in-person attention. They were invited to hourlong virtual forums, united on a group Slack channel and, finally, hosted at Harvard. But the core themes were what the researchers were watching. They would keep an eye on the influencers’ feeds and measure how much of Harvard’s material had ended up online.

Step 3: This study is not without limitations
A month after the gathering, Ms. Havekost was once again feeling depleted. It wasn’t that she didn’t care about her duty as a public health leader — on the contrary, she said, “every time I post something now, I think about Harvard.”

But she saw no simple way to integrate public health messages into her videos, which frequently feature her dancing uninhibitedly, or gazing at the viewer with an expression of unconditional love while text scrolls past. Her audience knows her communication style, she said; study citations wouldn’t feel any more authentic than cleavage enhancement.

Mr. Tucker, back in Chattanooga, reached a similar conclusion. He has 1.1 million TikTok followers, so he knows which themes attract viewers. Trauma, anxiety, toxic relationships, narcissistic personalities, “those are the catnip, so to speak,” he said. “Basically, stuff that feeds the victim mentality.”

He had tried a couple of videos based on Harvard research — for example, on the way the brain responds to the sound of water — but they had performed poorly with his audience, something he thought might be a function of the platform’s algorithm.

“They are not really trying to help spread good research,” Mr. Tucker said. “They are trying to keep eyeballs engaged so they can keep watch times as long as possible and pass that onto advertisers.”

It was different for Ms. Speer. After returning from Harvard, she received an email from S. Bryn Austin, a professor of social and behavioral sciences and a specialist in eating disorders, proposing that they collaborate on a campaign to prohibit the sale of weight-loss pills to minors in New York State.

Ms. Speer was elated. She got to work putting together a sizzle reel and a grant proposal. As summer turned to fall, her life seemed to have turned a corner. “That’s what I want to do,” she said. “I want to do it for good, instead of, you know, for lip gloss.”

Step 4: System-level effects

Last week, in a conference room overlooking the Hudson River, Ms. Yarnell and one of her co-authors, Matt Motta, of Boston University, presented the results of the experiment.

It had worked, they announced. The 42 influencers who received Harvard’s talking points were 3 percent more likely to post content on the core themes researchers had fed them. Although that may seem like a small effect, Dr. Motta said, each influencer had such a large audience that the additional content was viewed 800,000 times.

These successes bore little resemblance to peer-reviewed studies. They looked like @drkojosarfo, a psychiatric nurse practitioner with 2.4 million followers, dancing in a galley kitchen alongside text on the mind-body link, or the user @latinxtherapy throwing shade on insurance companies while lip-syncing to the influencer Shawty Bae.

The uptake seemed to be driven by the distribution of written materials, with no additional effect among subjects who had deep interactions with Harvard faculty. That was unexpected, Ms. Yarnell said, but it was good news, since digital tool kits are cheap and easy to scale.

“It’s simpler than we thought,” she said. “These written materials are useful to creators.”

But the biggest effect was something that did not show up in the data: the formation of new relationships. Seated beside Ms. Yarnell as she presented the experiment’s results were two of its subjects: Ms. Speer, with her service dog, Waffle, who is trained to paw at her when she smells elevated cortisol in her sweat, and Dr. Sasha Hamdani, a psychiatrist in Kansas who presents information on A.D.H.D. to the accompaniment of sea shanties.

Contact had been made. In the audience, the Brooklyn-dad influencer Timm Chiusano was wondering about how to build his own partnership with Harvard’s School of Public Health. “I’m going to 1,000 percent download that tool kit as soon as I can,” he said.

But who was boosting who? Ms. Mahler, who was promoting a new book on toxic relationships, sounded a little sad when she considered her partners in academia. “Harvard has this abundant knowledge base,” she said, “if they can just find a way of connecting to the people doing the digesting.”

She had learned a great deal about scientists. In some cases, Ms. Mahler said, they spend 10 years on a research project, publish an article, “and maybe it gets picked up, but sometimes it never reaches the general public in a way that really changes the conversation.”

“My heart kind of breaks for those people,” she said."
"Lab Leak Fight Casts Chill Over Virology Research
Scientists doing “gain-of-function” research said that heightened fears of lab leaks are stalling studies that could thwart the next pandemic virus.

Questions about whether Covid leaked from a Chinese laboratory have cast a chill over American virus research, drying up funding for scientists who collect or alter dangerous pathogens and intensifying a debate over those practices.

The pullback has transformed one of the most highly charged fields of medical science. While some believe such experiments could fend off the next pandemic, others worry that they are more likely to start one.

At Pennsylvania State University, a proposal to infect ferrets with a mutant bird flu virus passed the federal government’s most rigorous biosafety review only to be rebuffed by the National Institutes of Health. Troy Sutton, the scientist behind the studies, said that health officials referred to the public controversy over the lab leak theory in advising him to pursue different experiments.

In Washington, international development officials pulled the plug this summer on a $125 million program to collect animal viruses on several continents after two senior Republican senators demanded that they end the project.

And elsewhere in the United States, nearly two dozen virologists, some of whom spoke anonymously for fear of jeopardizing funding or career prospects, described a professionwide retreat from sensitive experiments. Some said that they had stopped proposing such work because research plans were languishing in long and opaque government reviews. One virologist said that university administrators had asked him to remove his name from a study done with colleagues in China.

Some of the affected experiments constitute gain-of-function research, in which scientists genetically alter a virus to see whether that makes the pathogen deadlier or more contagious.

To proponents of such work, there is no better way to home in on what mutations make a virus dangerous. Those findings, in turn, can help researchers spot the most worrisome of the new pathogens constantly jumping from animals to humans or prepare vaccines to target pandemic-ready viruses.

“The next flu pandemic is brewing in nature, but we have very little means of stopping it, very little means of identifying what the most dangerous viruses are,” said Dr. Sutton, the Penn State virologist. “This freight train is coming, and we need to do anything we can do to get ahead of that.”

But critics say that fiddling with deadly viruses poses intolerable risks for the sake of only hazy public health benefits. Lab mishaps have happened, including in the United States. However small the odds of a lab-generated outbreak, a leak could be catastrophic. If political concerns are intensifying scrutiny of gain-of-function studies, those scientists say, the result is still a much-needed recalibration of the risks and benefits of such work.

“I think there’s lots of good reason to try to remove politics from science, but I can’t complain when what I regard as legitimate political criticism of certain kinds of science affects the judgment of funding agencies,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard who has long questioned the benefits of disease-enhancing experiments. “Ultimately, they are spending tax dollars.”

In the Covid pandemic, both sides of the debate have found powerful grist.

The possibility that Covid emerged from a lab fueled appeals from biosafety proponents for a clampdown on experiments with even a remote chance of triggering a similar outcome. At the same time, studies suggesting that Covid spilled instead from an illegal animal market reinforced scientists’ fears of the dangerous mutations that viruses pick up in nature — and the need to prepare for them with safer studies in a lab.

The next threat may not be far off: A new bird flu variant known as H5N1 has felled many millions of birds globally, sporadically jumping into their handlers as it spreads.

New Rules

Dr. Sutton was apprenticing in a leading bird flu lab when, in 2011, a firestorm erupted in his field.

More on Covid-19
N95 Companies: Project N95 and Mask-C, two face mask providers, said they were closing, a sign of the slow and steady decline of what was once a much-sought-after item.
Omicron: In the two years since its emergence, the dominant variant of the coronavirus has proved to be not only staggeringly infectious, but an evolutionary marvel, challenging many assumptions virologists had before the pandemic.
Long Covid: As more young Americans report serious cognitive problems, scientists suggest that the increase captures the effects of long Covid, most likely in addition to other effects of the pandemic, including psychological distress.
Stroke Risk: The Covid vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may be linked to a slight increase in the risk of stroke when administered along with a high-dose flu vaccine that is usually given to older people, according to a new analysis by the F.D.A.
Two groups — one in the United States and one in the Netherlands — tweaked the genes of bird flu viruses to make them more transmissible, showing that such viruses could evolve to trigger human pandemics.

To critics, the studies became a byword for reckless experiments that risked kindling horrific outbreaks for only modest scientific knowledge. Lab leaks were responsible for the last cases of smallpox, in 1978, and for infections among scientists in Asia with an earlier coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, in 2003 and 2004.

But other researchers saw the bird flu studies as critical for mapping the virus’s evolutionary potential. Because of those studies, scientists said, they now know what to look for when sequencing the viruses that are decimating bird colonies. Similar experiments have helped researchers pick viruses to target with prepandemic vaccines.

With those debates flaring, and the discovery in 2014 of forgotten vials of smallpox on the N.I.H. campus, the Obama administration temporarily suspended funding that year for gain-of-function work. Dr. Sutton had just completed bird flu studies at the University of Maryland that underwent layers of special government review and drew criticism from some scientists.

He told his wife it might be time to leave academic research.

But the Trump administration lifted the pause and implemented new oversight rules in 2017 — the same year that Dr. Sutton opened his Penn State lab. Under the new rules, a specialized government committee would review certain gain-of-function proposals, another step in a vetting process that includes lab inspections and university biosafety reviews.

The committee keeps secret its membership as well as details about deliberations. Its oversight is limited to government-funded research. And it has vetted only three projects — partly because some scientists, fearing prolonged reviews, started shelving proposals that could trigger them.

Dr. Sutton, though, was not discouraged. He trained in virology at the same hospital in Vancouver where, when he was 12, his mother died of cancer. He felt that science had fallen short. To protect people’s health, researchers needed to investigate new frontiers of disease.

The third project that the gain-of-function committee reviewed was his.

‘They Weren’t Comfortable’

Penn State’s high-security lab, tucked on a remote corner of campus behind tall fencing, operates like a vacuum: Outdoor air flows in before being sucked back out through filters that clean the exhaust by removing contaminated particles. Before handling viruses, scientists strap on battery-powered filtration hoods. They exchange their street clothes for protective gear while they work and shower on the way out.

There, in 2018, Dr. Sutton proposed conducting bird flu studies.

Dr. Sutton was preoccupied with the H7N9 strain of the virus, which at the time had been spreading in poultry and occasionally jumping to people, killing 40 percent of patients. Fears that the virus could mutate, allowing it to spread easily from person to person, prompted American health officials to classify it as “having the greatest potential to cause a pandemic.”

He wanted to know how close that scenario was to becoming reality.

In earlier studies, Dr. Sutton had discovered an alarming clue. The virus, which transmitted poorly among people, should also have struggled to spread among ferrets, mammals used as experimental stand-ins for humans. But to his surprise, the virus sometimes jumped from one ferret to another, picking up genetic mutations.

Did those mutations appear at random? Or were they endowing the virus with just what it needed to spread, offering a preview of how the wild virus could evolve to start a pandemic?

His 2018 proposal suggested addressing that question by creating versions of the virus with those mutations and infecting ferrets with them.

At the N.I.H., the experiments passed their first test: An influential panel of expert scientists recommended them for funding. Then came the gain-of-function committee.

The committee pored over his study, Dr. Sutton said, asking about trainings, equipment and worker screenings. In February 2020, he said, the panel reported being satisfied that the project could proceed with a few clarifications. It just needed approval from N.I.H. leaders.

Dr. Sutton made the requested clarifications, he said, and resubmitted his plans in the summer of 2020. By then, Covid had arrived — and with it, questions that would drastically alter the political climate around virology research.

Some scientists suggested that the virus had leaked out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a Chinese coronavirus lab that had received research funding from the N.I.H. No public evidence indicates that the institute was storing any pathogen that could have become the coronavirus. Still, President Donald J. Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill amplified the concerns.

Inside the N.I.H., the political feud took a toll, raising the cost to the agency of becoming embroiled in additional controversies. A flurry of Congressional requests soon piled up, as did more public records requests than usual.

The scrutiny seemed to make government scientists skittish. Dr. Sutton said his primary contact at the N.I.H. told him by phone in the summer of 2020 that the agency would not fund his ferret transmission studies and encouraged him to find other ways of studying the virus.

“They just said, ‘You know, there’s a lot of controversy about this kind of work in the news right now,’” Dr. Sutton recalled. “They weren’t comfortable funding it.”

In a statement, Dr. Emily Erbelding, an N.I.H. official, said the agency had needed to do additional reviews of the proposal. Dr. Sutton’s updated submission arrived near the busy end of a fiscal year, she said, and officials had limited time to decide whether to fund it.

A year later, in September 2021, the agency instead gave Dr. Sutton money for modified experiments that added the mutations only to a weakened virus. He would also examine them in a petri dish rather than in live animals. The work, undertaken in the same high-security lab, was less risky, he said, but also less informative.

Some scientists said that the experiments as originally planned may not have produced enough insights to justify the risk. Viruses behave differently in ferrets than in humans, and mutations that may enhance one variant can have different effects on another.

But other researchers said that only the animal studies could have revealed what viral traits would turn that bird flu into a pandemic threat, informing decisions down the road about whether to ramp up testing, make vaccines or isolate cases if similar traits were to emerge in real-world pathogens.

Senator Pushback

By the fall of 2021, when Dr. Sutton started running the tamer version of his studies, the debate over Covid’s origins had intensified. In hearings, Republican senators were hammering health officials over funding virus research abroad.

Nevertheless, the United States Agency for International Development made a big announcement: It would spend $125 million to partner with labs around the world to collect unknown animal viruses and prepare for those that could trigger a pandemic.

The scientists chosen for the project, known as DEEP VZN, tried to insulate the work from political blowback, four researchers involved with the effort said. They did not propose gain-of-function experiments. They would not work in China.

Their biosafety plan, which was reviewed by The Times and approved by the aid agency, included medical screenings of field workers, as well as spot checks and audits by biosafety specialists.

But the project soon ran into trouble on Capitol Hill. In November 2021, two Republicans with powerful roles on committees that oversee the agency and its funding — Senator Jim Risch of Idaho and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina — sent a letter demanding details about the effort, citing concerns about previous federal funding for research in China.

The agency solicited input from health and security officials, including in the White House, according to a U.S.A.I.D. official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Some supported the program, which aimed to train scientists in poorer nations to safely identify viruses. Others worried that field researchers risked becoming infected by pathogens that might never have jumped into people otherwise.

Eric S. Lander, then President Biden’s science adviser, publicly doubted scientists’ ability to identify future pandemic viruses. Jason Matheny, then a technology and national security expert at the National Security Council, worried that identifying new viruses would assist bioweapons creators.

But if federal officials delivered mixed reviews, Republican senators intensified their objections. In a February 2022 letter, Senators Risch and Graham demanded that U.S.A.I.D. “immediately cease all work” on the project, a request that got the aid agency’s attention, the official said.

Scientists on the project, led by a Washington State University group, received word that they needed to assuage the senators, the four researchers said.

They confined the project to fewer countries. They agreed to inactivate any viruses in the field, a move that would protect workers handling the samples back at the lab — though at the expense of any insights gleaned from growing live viruses. And they focused on plans to sample domestic animals that already had contact with people.

The aid agency held five briefings with Senate staff members. But the precautions were not enough — for the project’s detractors on Capitol Hill or for the scientists who remained unconvinced that such work was safe or likely to ever help anticipate a pandemic.

This summer, before field work had begun, U.S.A.I.D. privately told scientists that it was canceling their funding. The BMJ, a medical journal, first reported on the decision and opposition to the program.

In poorer nations that had been promised funding, the project’s undoing damaged efforts to train workers to safely identify not only animal viruses but also human outbreaks.

Pablo Tsukayama, a Peruvian microbiologist, said he was forced to fire four scientists who planned to study viral samples. He also shelved plans to purchase biocontainment hoods and ventilation systems.

“We were planning to bring these labs up to the highest safety standards,” he said. “That’s why the U.S. funding was key.”

Abandoning Studies

Virologists and biosafety experts largely agree on one point: The federal government’s vetting process is too opaque and too slow.

One scientist, a longtime recipient of N.I.H. funding, said that a proposal of his, aimed at understanding super-contagious coronavirus variants, languished with health officials for more than a year.

The proposal suggested adding a mutation from the variants to a weakened version of the original coronavirus from 2020, work intended to identify targets for surveillance or new drugs. The mutation is already in viruses sickening thousands of people every day.

In an email, reviewed by The Times, health officials told him the proposal needed further review because it might constitute gain-of-function research. But he said that he knew little about how long the evaluation would take, who was conducting it or what safety measures he could introduce to assuage concerns.

“There are ways to do these things safely,” he said. “But the delay in responding means you’re functionally stopping this research.”

Dr. Erbelding, of the N.I.H., said that the gain-of-function vetting process had not changed since its introduction in 2017. An increase in virology proposals because of the pandemic, she said, may have contributed to the perception that reviews have slowed.

The White House is reviewing gain-of-function oversight policies after an expert panel this year endorsed sweeping reforms. Without clearer guidance, though, some virologists said they were ditching projects for fear of finding themselves in the cross hairs of a congressional inquiry or a yearslong biosafety review.

“Scientists are backing away from certain lines of research just in anticipation of the delays and paperwork,” Anice Lowen, an influenza virologist at Emory University, said. “A lot of parties are becoming more conservative.”

For biosafety proponents, the extra scrutiny has filled a void left by an absence of new regulations. But other scientists said that studies were being stifled even before health officials could assess them, driving research to nations with weaker biosafety practices and leaving basic questions about the coronavirus unanswered.

Dr. Sutton himself has stopped proposing gain-of-function experiments. He said he welcomed oversight and had even worked to ensure that his project was subject to a second government review that it could technically have avoided. But the long and unpredictable biosafety process, he said, was making it difficult to keep his lab running.

“The cost of dealing with the regulations is too high,” he said. “I stopped dreaming up those kinds of experiments.”"
"Robert Sapolsky Doesn’t Believe in Free Will. (But Feel Free to Disagree.)
Shedding the concept “completely strikes at our sense of identity and autonomy,” the Stanford biologist and neuroscientist argues. It might also be liberating.

There is no free will, according to Robert Sapolsky, a biologist and neuroscientist at Stanford University and a recipient of the MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant. Dr. Sapolsky worked for decades as a field primatologist before turning to neuroscience, and he has spent his career investigating behavior across the animal kingdom and writing about it in books including “Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst” and “Monkeyluv, and Other Essays on Our Lives as Animals.”

In his latest book, “Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will,” Dr. Sapolsky confronts and refutes the biological and philosophical arguments for free will. He contends that we are not free agents, but that biology, hormones, childhood and life circumstances coalesce to produce actions that we merely feel were ours to choose.

It’s a provocative claim, he concedes, but he would be content if readers simply began to question the belief, which is embedded in our cultural conversation. Getting rid of free will “completely strikes at our sense of identity and autonomy and where we get meaning from,” Dr. Sapolsky said, and this makes the idea particularly hard to shake.

There are major implications, he notes: Absent free will, no one should be held responsible for their behavior, good or bad. Dr. Sapolsky sees this as “liberating” for most people, for whom “life has been about being blamed and punished and deprived and ignored for things they have no control over.”

He spoke in a series of interviews about the challenges that free will presents and how he stays motivated without it. These conversations were edited and condensed for clarity.

To most people, free will means being in charge of our actions. What’s wrong with that outlook?

It’s a completely useless definition. When most people think they’re discerning free will, what they mean is somebody intended to do what they did: Something has just happened; somebody pulled the trigger. They understood the consequences and knew that alternative behaviors were available.

But that doesn’t remotely begin to touch it, because you’ve got to ask: Where did that intent come from? That’s what happened a minute before, in the years before, and everything in between.

For that sort of free will to exist, it would have to function on a biological level completely independently of the history of that organism. You would be able to identify the neurons that caused a particular behavior, and it wouldn’t matter what any other neuron in the brain was doing, what the environment was, what the person’s hormone levels were, what culture they were brought up in. Show me that those neurons would do the exact same thing with all these other things changed, and you’ve proven free will to me.

So, whether I wore a red or blue shirt today — are you saying I didn’t really choose that?

Absolutely. It can play out in the seconds before. Studies show that if you’re sitting in a room with a terrible smell, people become more socially conservative. Some of that has to do with genetics: What’s the makeup of their olfactory receptors? With childhood: What conditioning did they have to particular smells? All of that affects the outcome.

What about something bigger, like choosing where to go to college?

You ask, “Why did you pick this one?” And the person says, “I’ve learned that I do better in smaller classes.” Or, “They have an amazing party scene.” At any meaningful juncture, we’re making decisions based on our tastes and predilections and values and character. And you have to ask: Where did they come from?

Neuroscience is getting really good at two levels of stuff. One is understanding what a particular part of the brain does, based on techniques like neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

The other is at the level of tiny, reductive stuff: This variant of this gene interacts with this enzyme differently. So, we kind of understand what happens in one neuron. But how do 30 billion of them collectively make this a human cortex instead of a primate cortex? How do you scale up from understanding little component parts and getting some sense of the big, emergent thing?

Say we figured that out. Have X happen 4,000 times per second in Y part of the brain, countered — as an opposing, inhibitory thing — 2,123 times a second when the hormone levels are doing such-and-such. How does this big thing called a “behavior” or a “personality” or a “thought” or a “mistake” pop out at the macro level? We’re beginning to understand how you get from one level to the other, but it’s unbelievably difficult.

If we’re not responsible for our actions, can we take ownership of them?

Well, we can take ownership in a purely mechanical sense. My molecules knocked into the molecules making up that vase of flowers and knocked it over and broke it — that’s true. And we can keep ourselves going with myths of agency when it really doesn’t make a difference. If you want to believe that you freely chose to floss your upper teeth before your bottom teeth today, that’s a benign myth to operate with.

But you’re saying that the myth isn’t always benign?

Fundamentally injurious things about our universe run on the notion that people get stuff that they didn’t earn or they didn’t deserve, and a huge amount of humanity’s misery is due to myths of free will.

Most of the time, I get by without having to pay any attention whatsoever to how I think things work. Recognize how hard it is to do otherwise. Save that recognition for when it matters: when you’re on a jury; when you’re a schoolteacher, assessing students. If you have myths about free will, keep it to how you’re flossing your teeth.

I want to wean people off the knee-jerk reaction to the notion that without free will, we will run amok because we can’t be held responsible for things. That we have no societal mechanisms for having dangerous people not be dangerous, or for having gifted people do the things society needs to function. It’s not the case that in a deterministic world, nothing can change.

How should privileged people think about their accomplishments?

Every living organism is just a biological machine. But we’re the only ones that know that we’re biological machines; we are trying to make sense of the fact that we feel as if our feelings are real.

At some point, it doesn’t make a difference whether your feelings are real or whether your feeling of feelings being real is the case. We still find things aversive enough as biological machines that it’s useful to call stuff like that “pain” or “sadness” or “unhappiness.” And even though it’s completely absurd to think that something good can happen to a machine, it’s good when the feeling of feeling pain is lessened.

That’s a level on which we have to function. Meaning feels real. Purpose feels real. Every now and then, our knowledge of the machine-ness should not get in the way of the fact that this is a weird machine that feels as if feelings are real.

Do we lose love, too, if we lose free will?

Yeah. Like: “Wow! Why? Why did this person turn out to love me? Where did that come from? And how much of that has to do with how my parents raised me, or what sort of olfactory receptor genes I have in my nose and how much I like their scent?” At some point you get to that existential crisis of, “Oh God, that’s what’s underlying all this stuff!” That’s where the machine-ness becomes something we should be willing to ignore.

But it’s not OK for you to decide, with the same denial of reality, that you truly deserve a better salary than the average human on this planet.

Do it for where it’s needed. I sure can’t do it more than a tiny percent of the time. Like once every three and a half weeks or so. It’s a confusing, recursive challenge to watch yourself watching yourself, and to decide that what you’re feeling feels real."
"Wearables Track Parkinson’s Better Than Human Observation, Study Finds

The News
An Oxford University researcher and her team showed that digital wearable devices can track the progression of Parkinson’s disease in an individual more effectively than human clinical observation can, according to a newly published paper.

By tracking more than 100 metrics picked up by the devices, researchers were able to discern subtle changes in the movements of subjects with Parkinson’s, a neurodegenerative disease that afflicts 10 million people worldwide.

The lead researcher emphasized that the latest findings were not a treatment for Parkinson’s. Rather, they are a means of helping scientists gauge whether novel drugs and other therapies for Parkinson’s are slowing the progression of the disease.

Quotable Quotes
The sensors — six per subject, worn on the chest, at the base of the spine and one on each wrist and foot — tracked 122 physiological metrics. Several dozen metrics stood out as closely indicating the disease’s progression, including the direction a toe moved during a step and the length and regularity of strides.

“We have the biomarker,” said Chrystalina Antoniades, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford and the lead researcher on the paper, which was published earlier this month in the journal npj Parkinson’s Disease. “It’s super exciting. Now we hope to be able to tell you: Is a drug working?”

Until now, Dr. Antoniades said, drug trials for Parkinson’s had relied on clinical assessment of whether a treatment was slowing the progression of the disease. But clinical observation can miss changes that happen day to day or that might not show up clearly in periodic visits to a doctor, she added.

In the paper, the study’s authors concluded that the sensors proved more effective at tracking the disease progression “than the conventionally used clinical rating scales.”

What It Looks Like
To capture the wearer’s various movements, the sensors employed technologies, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, that have become increasingly common in digital watches and smartphones. Together, these devices can measure a person’s direction, gait, regularity of movement and more.

After the results were published, Dr. Antoniades and her team were flooded with messages from colleagues and media outlets asking whether they had found a cure for Parkinson’s. She said she wanted to be clear that the advance, while important, was a tool that could hasten the development of treatments for the disease, but that it was not the answer to it.

What’s Next
Dr. Antoniades said she was optimistic about the possibility of using such sensors to track other illnesses, perhaps even Alzheimer’s — a “plethora of diseases that bring together bioengineering, clinical science and movement science.”

Human doctors will remain a vital part of the process, she added, with sensors complementing the observations of clinicians. The hope, Dr. Antoniades said, “is this will enhance the ability of your doctor to get it right.”"
"Scientists Investigating Alzheimer’s Drug Faulted in Leaked Report
A professor at the City College of New York engaged in “significant research misconduct,” an expert committee concluded.

A neuroscientist whose studies undergird an experimental Alzheimer’s drug was “reckless” in his failure to keep or provide original data, an offense that “amounts to significant research misconduct,” an investigation by his university has concluded.

The drug, simufilam, is made by Cassava Sciences, a pharmaceutical company based in Texas, and is in advanced clinical trials. The neuroscientist, Hoau-Yan Wang, a professor at the City College of New York, frequently collaborated with Lindsay H. Burns, the company’s chief scientist, on studies that outside experts and journals have called into question.

A committee was convened by the City University of New York, of which the college is a part, to investigate the work, and it concluded in a report that Dr. Burns was responsible for errors in some of the papers. But the investigators reserved their sharpest criticism for Dr. Wang, reproaching him for “long-standing and egregious misconduct in data management and record keeping.”

The report was obtained and made public by the journal Science on Thursday. Dee Dee Mozeleski, a spokeswoman for City College, declined to comment on the document but said that the school would formally release the report later this month.

Dr. Wang did not respond to a request for comment. Remi Barbier, the founder and chief executive of Cassava, said in a statement that the company would continue its clinical trials. “We remain confident in the underlying science for simufilam, our lead drug candidate,” he said.

Alzheimer’s disease affects roughly six million Americans. Simufilam has been eagerly anticipated by patients and families, and fervidly supported by a group of investors. Cassava’s stock soared after each round of reported results from its trials — at one point by more than 1,500 percent.

But some scientists have been skeptical of the drug’s hypothesized mode of action and of claims of improvements among patients in Cassava’s clinical trials. A few accused the company and Dr. Wang of manipulating the results.

In August 2021, two scientists filed a citizen’s petition with the Food and Drug Administration in which they described “grave concerns about the quality and integrity” of the research that supported simufilam’s purported efficacy.

Mr. Barbier has called the two scientists “bad actors” because they held a short position in Cassava’s stock and profited from its decline.

The release of the new report was preceded by a 40 percent increase in short selling of Cassava stocks, according to the company’s statement. Cassava was once valued at nearly $5 billion, but it was worth about $624 million as of Friday.

Other scientists, including some experts on Alzheimer’s disease, also pointed out what they said were irregularities in the results published by Dr. Wang and Dr. Burns, particularly in images. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Institutes of Health began investigating Cassava’s research in 2021 as well.

Some scientific journals that published Dr. Wang’s papers have made their own inquiries. Two of them published “expressions of concern” questioning the integrity and accuracy of the results. Another journal, PLOS One, retracted five papers by Dr. Wang after a five-month investigation.

The committee convened by CUNY also began investigating Dr. Wang’s work and his lab’s funding and spending over nearly 20 years. The group examined 31 allegations described by the Office of Research Integrity, the federal agency that helps universities handle scientific misconduct.

The committee members struggled for months to obtain access to Dr. Wang’s files, and did not succeed until they involved the college’s president. Even so, the report said, they were “unable to objectively assess” the merits of most of the allegations because Dr. Wang had not provided primary data, original images, research notebooks or other records of the experiments.

What the committee did find was “highly suggestive of deliberate scientific misconduct by Dr. Wang for 14 of the 31 allegations,” according to the report.

Cassava’s statement noted that the report faulted only internal record-keeping failures and did not find proof of data manipulation, and said that CUNY turned down all requests for information and offers of assistance and did not interview any of its employees.

Ms. Mozeleski said that CUNY would not comment on those allegations.

According to the report, Dr. Wang said some of his research records were missing because boxes containing them had been discarded during the coronavirus pandemic in response to a request from the college.

“The college did not require any member of our faculty or staff to throw out any items during the pandemic,” Ms. Mozeleski said in an email.

"California’s Ban on Red Food Dye Puts F.D.A.’s Food Policies on the Spot
The dye was banned in cosmetics after a study suggested it might be a carcinogen. Yet federal regulations still permit its use in foods, stoking concerns that helped build support for the new state law.

Thirty-three years after the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of Red Dye No. 3 in red lipstick and other cosmetics by linking it to cancer, California has become the first state to ban the chemical in food.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed a law this month that outlawed the red dye and three other chemicals. Red No. 3 is used in Halloween treats and other foods, including private-label candy, cookies and frostings sold at national chains such as Walmart and Target.

The California law increases public pressure on the F.D.A. to examine similar questions surrounding artificial colors and other ingredients. But the agency itself is in a state of flux after the infant formula scandal raised concerns about food oversight. Dr. Robert Califf, the F.D.A. commissioner, has begun a reorganization of its beleaguered food division, marked by the departure of two top officials and the appointment of a deputy commissioner with significant experience in food safety.

Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat who represents a district near Los Angeles, said the federal agency’s inaction along with loopholes in food safety regulations had contributed to the state lawmakers’ reasoning in supporting the measure.

“The primary purpose of this bill was to protect kids and families and consumers in the state of California,” he said. “But a secondary purpose here was to send a message to Washington that the F.D.A. process is broken, and hopefully to spur momentum in Washington D.C. for real, significant change.”

The F.D.A. said in a statement that it “evaluates and regulates ingredients added to food to ensure that the authorized use of these ingredients is safe. This includes the four ingredients included in the California bill.”

The California law applies to food chemicals that are also banned in the European Union and in some other nations. The red dye is still permitted for use in maraschino cherries.

First approved for use in food in 1907, Red Dye No. 3 was banned in cosmetics by U.S. regulators in 1990. At the time, the F.D.A. cited an industry-conducted study that found that the chemical caused thyroid cancer in male rats (but not mice) but estimated that it might cause cancer in fewer than 1 in 100,000 people. Along with prohibiting the dye in cosmetics, the agency pledged to do the same with food.

“We’re stuck in this regulatory quandary where you’re not allowed to apply it to your skin, but you can ingest it in food — so it’s completely illogical,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, which signed the petition and supported the California bill.

In the ensuing decades, though, the red dye became a common coloring agent in candies and frosting. Last year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, along with other advocacy groups, petitioned the F.D.A. to take action against it. The F.D.A. said it is reviewing the petition and has examined the safety of the dye, including the rat studies, which it said are “not relevant to human cancer.”

The petition also cited a California study in 2021 that linked Red Dye No. 3 and other dyes to behavioral problems in some children.

At a grocery store in northern New Jersey, examples could be found of foods that included Red Dye No. 3; Nestle’s strawberry Nesquik drink and the strawberry-flavored Funfetti Mermaid frosting, made by General Mills’s Pillsbury. The synthetic coloring agent is also found in cookies, fruit cocktail cups and sprinkles for treats sold under private labels at Target and Walmart, according to a food database maintained by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Nestle, General Mills, and Walmart did not respond to emails seeking comment. Target said in a statement that it requires its vendors to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws.

Some companies said they were working to remove Red Dye No. 3 from their products. Just Born, which makes Peeps, the squishy marshmallow candy, said only two colors — pink and lavender Peeps — would be made using the dye in 2024. After next spring, the dye would be phased out of all of its products, the company said.

“We have worked hard to develop new formulations,” Keith Domalewski, director of marketing at Just Born, said in an email.

He added that another popular treat, Hot Tamales, was no longer made with Red Dye No. 3 and that updated ingredient lists should soon be on store shelves nationwide.

The California legislation also banned brominated vegetable oil, which is mostly used in store-brand sodas to keep citrus flavoring from floating to the top. An F.D.A. study in 2022 found that the ingredient may disrupt hormones in rats. The agency has said it plans to ban the ingredient.

The state law, which takes effect in 2027, also outlaws potassium bromate, used in baked goods and tortillas. It has been deemed a possible human carcinogen by international experts, also based on animal studies. Propylparaben, also banned under the law, is a preservative in packaged baked goods that is believed to disrupt hormones and affect reproductive health.

The back story of chemicals like propylparaben propelled the bill forward, according to Susan Little, a California-based lobbyist for the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that supported the legislation. The chemical, in F.D.A. parlance, was “generally recognized as safe,” or GRAS, a designation that was initially assigned to ingredients like salt and vinegar, which were deemed permissible foods and chemicals with no in-depth review.

Acknowledging a cumbersome review process, the F.D.A. in 1997 allowed food companies to convene experts internally to certify some ingredients as safe. Companies could add them to food without any special notice to the public or the F.D.A., according to Jensen N. Jose, a lawyer with the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

“Many people were astounded to learn that the F.D.A. is not actively regulating the chemicals we put in our food,” Ms. Little said. “That piece of information came as a surprise to many people and was a reason the bill had the legs it had.”

Opposition to the California legislation was fierce for many months, but diminished when the sponsors dropped the part of the proposal that would have banned titanium dioxide, a chemical used to color food white or add a shiny appearance. The European Union banned the ingredient last year, saying it was uncertain whether the ingredient’s minuscule nanoparticles damaged DNA. The F.D.A. is reviewing a second petition seeking to remove that ingredient from food.

In California, the National Confectioners Association was among the food industry groups opposed to the bill, saying it would generate “a patchwork of inconsistent state requirements.”

“We should be relying on the scientific rigor of the F.D.A. in terms of evaluating the safety of food ingredients and additives,” Christopher Gindlesperger, an association vice president, said.

Frank Yiannas, a former top F.D.A. food official, said after his resignation early this year that he had since consulted for groups that “directly or indirectly have an interest in this topic.” He wrote an opinion article opposing the bill in September. On Thursday, he said that the California law “sets a dangerous precedent” in taking on a food-oversight role better performed by federal experts.

“I don’t think it adequately considered the longer-term, unintended consequences it could have on the U.S. food system,” said Mr. Yiannas, who was a Walmart food safety executive before joining the F.D.A. in 2018.

As the California bill and a pending measure in New York State aimed at eliminating titanium dioxide drew attention, Dr. Califf addressed the F.D.A.’s moves on food safety in May: “The F.D.A. is embarking on a more modernized, systematic reassessment of chemicals with a focus on post-market review.”

He also appealed to Congress for more funding and oversight powers to accomplish those goals. Since then, the F.D.A. has named James Jones to lead its food division, noting his experience as a pesticide regulator at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Nearly 10 years ago, Mars, Kellogg’s and General Mills pledged to remove synthetic colors from popular snacks and cereals, many of which are geared toward children.

But within a couple of years, many of the companies had reversed their decisions. General Mills said sales of its Trix cereal, appearing in more muted colors thanks to vegetable and fruit juices and other ingredients, initially exceeded expectations. But the company soon backpedaled, saying loyal customers were split, with some preferring brightly colored cereal made with artificial colors. WK Kellogg, a spinoff of Kellogg’s cereal business, did not respond to queries seeking comment.

In a statement, Mars said after research it had found that, “consumer expectations regarding colors in food differ widely across markets and categories.”

In grocery store aisles, a vast majority of red-hued beverages and treats, including Skittles, cherry Pop-Tarts, Fruity Pebbles cereal and strawberry Pedialyte, are made with Red Dye No. 40, another synthetic coloring.

The dye, also known as Allura Red, has also drawn scrutiny over the years. Some studies and researchers have linked the dye to hyperactivity in children, but a committee convened by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2011 found no “causal link.” Late last year, another study in mice raised concerns that Allura Red dye could increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease.

Supporters of the California measure said they hoped the F.D.A. and others would focus more on such additives and on overall food chemical oversight in the coming months.

“This regulatory system couldn’t get any better for the food industry and companies that sell chemicals to the food industry,” said Scott Faber, director of the Environmental Working Group.

"Doctors Unionize at Big Health Care System
The physicians, at Allina Health in Minnesota and Wisconsin, appear to be the largest group of unionized doctors in the private sector.

In the latest sign of growing frustration among professionals, doctors employed by a large nonprofit health care system in Minnesota and Wisconsin have voted to unionize.

The doctors, roughly 400 primary and urgent-care providers across more than 50 clinics operated by the Allina Health System, appear to be the largest group of unionized private-sector physicians in the United States. More than 150 nurse practitioners and physician assistants at the clinics were also eligible to vote and will be members of the union, which will be represented by a local of the Service Employees International Union.

The result was 325 to 200, with 24 other ballots challenged, according to a tally sheet from the National Labor Relations Board, which conducted the vote.

In a statement, Allina said, “While we are disappointed in the decision by some of our providers to be represented by a union, we remain committed to our ongoing work to create a culture where all employees feel supported and valued.”

The doctors complained that chronic understaffing was leading to burnout and compromising patient safety.

“In between patients, your doctor is dealing with prescription refills, phone calls and messages from patients, lab results,” said Dr. Cora Walsh, a family physician involved in the organizing campaign.

Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Tesla: Weeks after mechanics working for Tesla in Sweden walked off their jobs in late October, members of other unions across the country and elsewhere in Scandinavia have joined the strike in sympathy.
Amazon: More than a year and a half after workers on Staten Island voted to form the company’s first union in the United States, Amazon appears to be taking a harder line toward labor organizing.
Hollywood Actors: SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union, voted to approve a new three-year contract with studios, although some members remained dissatisfied with the deal’s A.I. protections. The ratification formally ended six months of labor unrest in the entertainment industry.
Doctors and Pharmacists: Medical professionals who once escaped the usual labor hierarchy are now unionizing, as the consolidation of health care companies has left them feeling powerless in big bureaucracies.
“At an adequately staffed clinic, you have enough support to help take some of that workload,” Dr. Walsh added. “When staff levels fall, that work doesn’t go away.”

Dr. Walsh estimated that she and her colleagues often spend an hour or two each night handling “inbox load” and worried that the shortages were increasing backlogs and the risk of mistakes.

The union vote follows recent walkouts by pharmacists in the Kansas City area and elsewhere over similar concerns.

A variety of professionals, including architects and tech workers, have sought to form unions in recent years, while others, like nurses and teachers, have waged strikes and aggressive contract bargaining campaigns.

Some argue that employers have exploited their sense of mission to pay them less than their skills warrant, or to work them around the clock. Others contend that new business models or budget pressures are compromising their independence and interfering with their professional judgment.

Increasingly, doctors appear to be expressing both concerns.

“We feel like we’re not able to advocate for our patients,” said Dr. Matt Hoffman, another doctor involved in the organizing at Allina. Dr. Hoffman, referring to managers, added that “we’re not able to tell them what we need day to day.”

Consolidation in the health care industry over the past two decades appears to underlie much of the frustration among doctors, many of whom now work for large health care systems.

“When a physician ran his or her own practice, they made the decisions about the people and technology they surrounded themselves with,” Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said in an email. “Now, these decisions are made by administrators.”

Doctors at Allina say that staffing was a concern before the pandemic, that Covid-19 pushed them to the brink and that staffing has never fully recovered to its prepandemic levels.

Relatively low pay for clinical assistants and lab personnel appears to have contributed to the staffing issues, as these workers left for other fields in a tight job market. In some cases, doctors and other clinicians within the Allina system have quit or scaled back their hours, citing so-called moral injury — a sense that they couldn’t perform their jobs in accordance with their values.

“We were promised that when we get through the acute phase of the pandemic, staffing would get better,” Dr. Walsh said. “But staffing never improved.”

Allina, which takes in billions in revenue but has faced financial pressures and recently eliminated hundreds of positions, did not respond to questions about the doctors’ concerns.

Joe Crane, the national organizing director for the Doctors Council of the S.E.I.U., which represents attending physicians, said that before the pandemic, he would receive about 50 inquiries a year from doctors interested in learning more about forming a union. He said he received more than 150 inquiries during the first month of the pandemic. (Mr. Crane was with another physicians’ union at the time.)

Mr. Crane, citing the siloed nature of the medical profession, said that unionization among attending physicians had nonetheless proceeded slowly, but that the victory at Allina could create momentum.

In March, more than 100 doctors voted to unionize at another Allina facility, a hospital with two locations. Dr. Alia Sharif, a physician involved in that union campaign, said doctors were under pressure there not to exceed length-of-stay guidelines for patients, even though many suffer from complex conditions that require more sustained care.

Allina is appealing the outcome of that vote to the National Labor Relations Board in Washington; a board official rejected an earlier appeal.

Even as rates of unionization have languished among attending physicians, they have increased substantially among medical residents. A sister union within the S.E.I.U., the Committee of Interns and Residents, has added thousands of members over the past few years.

Dr. Wachter said this could herald an increase in unionization among doctors outside training programs. “When these physicians finish training and enter practice, they are more comfortable with a world in which unionization doesn’t automatically conflict with their notions of being a professional,” he wrote."
"F.D.A. Moves to Ban Sales of Vuse Menthol Vapes
R.J. Reynolds menthol e-cigarettes are top sellers with an estimated $1.6 billion in annual sales. The company vowed to fight the ruling in court.

The Food and Drug Administration has ordered R.J. Reynolds to stop selling its popular Vuse Alto menthol e-cigarettes, a decision Reynolds immediately said it would challenge in court.

On Thursday, the agency denied applications by Reynolds to keep its top-selling menthol products permanently on the market, saying that the company did not meet the federal standards that require the e-cigarettes to provide more of a health benefit than a risk. In the case of the Vuse vapes, the F.D.A. said the risks of attracting young people to the popular menthol and flavored products outweighed the potential for helping traditional smokers quit.

The decision does not apply to the company’s tobacco-flavored products.

Some public health experts have viewed the federal agency’s most recent rejections of menthol e-cigarettes as an indication that the agency is more strictly limiting menthol products. The F.D.A. is expected, perhaps by the end of this year, to move toward outlawing all menthol cigarettes, including Newports, a top seller for Reynolds with $7.5 billion in annual sales, according to Goldman Sachs research.

British American Tobacco, the parent company of R.J. Reynolds, said in a statement that the F.D.A.’s latest ruling “flies in the face of proven science.” The company said it would fight the decision in court, which could allow Reynolds to keep the disputed Vuse products on the market indefinitely.

Juul and other e-cigarette makers that are appealing similar agency decisions have been permitted to keep their vaping products on the shelves during litigation.

More on Smoking, Vaping and E-Cigarettes
Menthol Ban: The Biden administration delayed a decision about whether it would ban menthol cigarettes amid mounting opposition from tobacco companies and Black activists worried about police enforcement.
Smoking Bans: France unveiled a plan to ban smoking on beaches, near schools and in parks, while New Zealand’s new right-wing government has said it will repeal a law that would have made tobacco illegal.
A Gen Z Makeover: In candy shades and eggy shapes, many of today’s most popular vaping devices have a playful appearance. Experts worry they will hook a new generation of users.
A Viral Brand?: You can’t buy Hestia cigarettes at any bodega or tobacco shop in New York. But the company is getting its smokes into the hands of “cigfluencers.”
If the F.D.A. were to succeed in court against Reynolds, the company would be dealt a severe financial blow. Market data analyzed by Goldman Sachs indicates that the menthol variety is the top seller of Vuse products, and those menthol vapes make up about 29 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market, representing $1.6 billion in sales. Overall, Vuse products, including tobacco-flavored products, comprise 40 percent of the market.

The F.D.A. has had the authority to determine the sale of e-cigarettes since 2016. It has denied millions of applications either for products to stay on the market or for the sale of new vaping devices. The agency has pledged to decide every application by the end of this year.

Antismoking groups and others have urged the F.D.A. to more tightly regulate the e-cigarette market, and noted that a recent survey of middle and high school students showed that Vuse vapes were a popular choice among those who used e-cigarettes.

Reynolds has tried to position its products to regulators as legitimate alternatives for adults in an e-cigarette space flooded with illicit products. The company volunteered to stop selling its mixed berry flavor, which was also denied marketing authorization by the F.D.A. on Thursday.

“Central to the efficacy of any regulated market is the rule of law — where good behavior is encouraged, and bad behavior punished,” Kingsley Wheaton, a British American Tobacco executive, said in the company’s statement. “We also remain deeply concerned that the F.D.A. continues to allow the proliferation of youth-appealing vapor products like Cotton Candy and Peanut Butter Cookie, which are flooding U.S. retail shelves. Companies in open defiance of the agency must be held accountable.”

But Reynolds is contesting other restrictions. It has filed suit in California against the state’s new ban on flavored tobacco, after the state attorney general warned the company and another about marketing products that were said to have a “cooling” flavor.

Yolonda Richardson, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, applauded the F.D.A.’s decision on Vuse, saying it was “one of the strongest actions the F.D.A. has taken to rid the market of illegal, flavored e-cigarettes and is a necessary step toward ending the youth e-cigarette crisis in the United States.”

Alex Liber, a Georgetown University assistant professor and tobacco control policy researcher, recently worked on a paper linking flavored-vape bans to an increase in cigarette sales.

He said the F.D.A. appeared to be on a path of authorizing only vapes that taste like a cigarette. The agency has rejected other menthol e-cigarette applications, deeming them too alluring to adolescents to outweigh the benefit to adults.

“Whatever that bar and evidence is, I don’t think anyone has hit it,” Dr. Liber said. “I don’t know if F.D.A. knows what it looks like. I don’t know what that would be.”

"Kaiser Permanente Reaches Tentative Deal With Health Care Workers
The proposed settlement follows a three-day strike involving thousands of unionized workers in several states.

Kaiser Permanente reached a tentative deal with more than 75,000 of its health care workers Friday morning, a week after a three-day walkout that disrupted appointments and services at many hospitals and clinics.

The labor dispute was the latest in a series between health care  systems and their employees, many of whom cite exhaustion, burnout and frustration with severe staffing shortages that have persisted long past the worst of the pandemic’s crushing workload.

The proposed four-year contract would include significant wage increases, setting a new minimum of $25 an hour in California, about $5 an hour above the new raise approved for fast food workers and almost $10 an hour above the state’s basic minimum. (Separately on Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that would gradually raise wages to $25 an hour over the next several years for many of the state’s health care workers.)  

The unions said the proposed wage hikes at Kaiser facilities were essential to attracting enough workers to provide adequate staffing. The agreement would raise Kaiser’s hourly rate to $23 in other states and would stagger a 21 percent increase in wages over four years in all locations. It also includes what the union described as important protections against Kaiser’s ability to outsource jobs.

“Millions of Americans are safer today because tens of thousands of dedicated health care workers fought for and won the critical resources they need and that patients need,” Caroline Lucas, the executive director of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, which represents about half of Kaiser’s work force, said in a statement. “This historic agreement will set a higher standard for the health care industry nationwide.”

Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Tesla: Weeks after mechanics working for Tesla in Sweden walked off their jobs in late October, members of other unions across the country and elsewhere in Scandinavia have joined the strike in sympathy.
Amazon: More than a year and a half after workers on Staten Island voted to form the company’s first union in the United States, Amazon appears to be taking a harder line toward labor organizing.
Hollywood Actors: SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union, voted to approve a new three-year contract with studios, although some members remained dissatisfied with the deal’s A.I. protections. The ratification formally ended six months of labor unrest in the entertainment industry.
Doctors and Pharmacists: Medical professionals who once escaped the usual labor hierarchy are now unionizing, as the consolidation of health care companies has left them feeling powerless in big bureaucracies.
At a news conference on Friday afternoon, union and Kaiser officials said the agreement was key to ensuring that the organization would be able to attract and retain workers.

Kaiser officials also applauded the proposed settlement. They said in a statement: “The new four-year agreement will offer Coalition-represented employees competitive wages, excellent benefits, generous retirement income plans and valuable job training opportunities that support their economic well-being, advance our shared mission and keep Kaiser Permanente a best place to work and receive care.”

Workers’ “advocacy for safe staffing was a moral imperative,”  Ms. Lucas said.

Kaiser and the unions both credited the involvement of Julie Su, the acting U.S. labor secretary, for helping broker the tentative deal. Ms. Su traveled to California Thursday night to rejoin the talks, and the proposed settlement was reached early Friday.

“I’m very happy, very elated, very exhausted,” said Georgette Bradford, an ultrasound technologist at a breast imaging center in Sacramento, who served on the union’s bargaining team. Ms. Bradford, 48, who has taken part in several contract negotiations over her 19 years at Kaiser, said this agreement felt particularly special because of the camaraderie across other sectors during what she referred to as a “hot labor summer.”

“That support from others in the community was never seen to this level before,” she said. “It was overwhelming.”

Union members will vote on whether to ratify the deal on Wednesday.

Kaiser Permanente health plans cover 13 million people in eight states through its own network of hospitals and doctors.

The 72-hour walkout that ended nearly a week ago put a lot of pressure on Kaiser sites, which had to operate without thousands of medical assistants, laboratory technicians, receptionists and sanitation staff members who formed picket lines outside dozens of its buildings.

The work stoppage forced Kaiser to move many appointments online and to postpone procedures that weren’t considered urgent, like colonoscopies or mammograms. The company brought contingency workers into hospitals and urgency care centers, but more than 50 labs in Southern California were shut down, and dozens of other facilities throughout the West Coast either closed or limited their hours. Union leaders called it the largest strike by health care workers in recent U.S. history.

Kaiser’s stalemate drew the attention of Ms. Su, who traveled last week to San Francisco during the strike to meet with officials from both sides of the negotiations. But talks broke off, with the labor coalition threatening a weeklong walkout for early November if the two sides could not settle a contract beforehand.

The deal reflects a pivotal moment in the health labor market, after a significant exodus of staff members throughout the industry has left the supply of workers far below the demand. The dynamic has created a sense of urgency on each side: Workers trying to treat patients amid staffing shortages report record levels of burnout, while their employers are under pressure to preserve their workforces and offer packages that attract new workers.

Analysts say the situation has most likely provided union workers with leverage to get more at the table, and many are seizing the opportunity. More than a dozen health worker strikes have taken place this year in New York City, California, Illinois, Michigan and elsewhere.

The settlement, particularly the agreement on a higher minimum wage affecting low-income employees, “will impact health care workers outside of Kaiser,” said John August, who was the executive director for the coalition of Kaiser unions until 2013 and is now a program director at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations. “It’s a great pressure point for the rest of industry, for sure,” he said.

Kaiser officials acknowledged the importance of increasing pay for those workers struggling most with the rising cost of living. “We see the impact that this has on our employees,” said Steve Shields, a senior vice president who oversees labor relations for Kaiser. “We needed to do more for those on the lowest end of the wage scales.”  

About 1,500 health workers began a five-day strike against Prime’s St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, Calif., on Oct. 9, citing dangerous short-staffing practices. Pharmacy staff workers at some Walgreens stores in Oregon, Washington, Arizona and Massachusetts walked out on the same day, citing workloads so excessive that they could not safely fill prescriptions. Without a formal union, they organized on Facebook and Reddit.

The New York State Nurses Association entered a new contract with Mount Sinai Hospital, which includes an enforcement mechanism for nurse-patient staffing ratios.

But companies like Kaiser are under pressure to limit their expenses, and the organization emphasizes that it needs to make sure its care is affordable. The organization, which had operating revenue of $95.4 billion, reported an operating loss of $1.3 billion in 2022. In recent months, Kaiser has returned to profitability. Kaiser officials said the proposed deal should not result in higher rates for its members."
"The Human Brain Has a Dizzying Array of Mystery Cells
Researchers identified some 3,300 types of brain cells, an order of magnitude more than was previously known, and have only a dim notion of what most of them do.

An international team of scientists has mapped the human brain in much finer resolution than ever before. The brain atlas, a $375 million effort started in 2017, has identified more than 3,300 types of brain cells, an order of magnitude more than was previously reported. The researchers have only a dim notion of what the newly discovered cells do.

The results were described in 21 papers published on Thursday in Science and several other journals.

Ed Lein, a neuroscientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle who led five of the studies, said that the findings were made possible by new technologies that allowed the researchers to probe millions of human brain cells collected from biopsied tissue or cadavers.

“It really shows what can be done now,” Dr. Lein said. “It opens up a whole new era of human neuroscience.”

Still, Dr. Lein said that the atlas was just a first draft. He and his colleagues have only sampled a tiny fraction of the 170 billion cells estimated to make up the human brain, and future surveys will certainly uncover more cell types, he said.

Biologists first noticed in the 1800s that the brain was made up of different kinds of cells. In the 1830s, the Czech scientist Jan Purkinje discovered that some brain cells had remarkably dense explosions of branches. Purkinje cells, as they are now known, are essential for fine-tuning our muscle movements.

Later generations developed techniques to make other cell types visible under a microscope. In the retina, for instance, researchers found cylindrical “cone cells” that capture light. By the early 2000s, researchers had found more than 60 types of neurons in the retina alone. They were left to wonder just how many kinds of cells were lurking in the deeper recesses of the brain, which are far harder to study.

With funding from the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Lein and his colleagues set out to map the brain by inspecting how brain cells activated different genes. At least 16,000 genes are active in the brain, and they are turned on in different combinations in different types of cells.

The researchers collected brain tissue from several sources, including people who had recently died and those who were undergoing brain surgery.

When studying fresh brain tissue, the scientists attached glass tubes to the surface of individual cells to eavesdrop on their electrical activity, injected dye to make out their structure and finally sucked out the nuclei from the cells to inspect them more closely.

Rather than carrying out these procedures by hand, the researchers designed robots to work efficiently through the samples. The robots have inspected more than 10 million human brain cells so far, Dr. Lein estimated.

Some of the newly identified cells were found in layers of cerebral cortex on the brain’s outer surface. This region is essential for complex mental tasks such as using language and making plans for the future.

But the new studies reveal that much of the brain’s diversity lies outside of the cerebral cortex. A vast number of the cell types uncovered in the project lie in the deeper regions of the brain, such as the brain stem that leads to the spinal cord.

The researchers found many new types of neurons, cells that use electric signals and chemicals to process information. But neurons make up only about half the cells in the brain. The other half are far more mysterious.

Astrocytes, for example, appear to nurture neurons so that they can keep working properly. Microglia serve as immune cells, attacking foreign invaders and pruning some of the branches on neurons to improve their signaling. And the researchers found many new types of these cells as well.

The researchers used some of the same methods to study the brains of chimpanzees and other species. By comparing the results among species, the researchers investigated how the human brain evolved to be different from those of other primates.

Previous studies had suggested that the human brain might be distinctive thanks in part to having evolved new kinds of cells. But the researchers were surprised to find that all of the cell types in human brains matched up with those found in chimpanzees and gorillas, our closest living relatives.

Within those cells, researchers discovered a few hundred genes that became either more or less active in humans than in other apes. Many of those genes are close to genetic switches that turn genes on or off.

Dr. Bakken and his colleagues found that a number of the genes that make humans distinct are involved in building the connections between neurons, known as synapses.

“It’s really the connections — how these cells are talking to each other — that makes us different from the chimpanzees,” said Trygve Bakken, a neuroscientist at the Allen Brain Institute who worked on the primate studies.

Megan Carey, a neuroscientist at the Champalimaud Center for the Unknown in Portugal who was not part of the brain atlas project, said that the research provided a staggering amount of new data for researchers to use in future studies. “I think this is a tremendous success story,” she said.

Yet she also cautioned that understanding how the human brain works would not be a matter of simply cataloging each and every part down to its finest details. Neuroscientists will also have to step back and look at the brain as a self-regulating system.

“There will be answers in this data set that will help us get closer to that,” Dr. Carey said. “We just don’t know which ones they are yet.”

Adam Hantman, a neuroscientist at the University of North Carolina who was not involved in the study, said that the atlas would be a big help for some kinds of research, like tracing the development of the brain. But he questioned whether a catalog of cell types would elucidate complex behavior.

“We want to know what the orchestra is doing,” he said. “We don’t really care what this one violinist is doing at this one moment.”"
"Mary Lou Retton Crowdfunded Her Medical Debt, Like Many Thousands of Others
But unlike the Olympic gymnast, most people don’t raise enough money to cover their costs.

When Mary Lou Retton, the decorated Olympic gymnast, accrued medical debt from a lengthy hospital stay, her family did what countless Americans have done before them: turned to crowdfunding to cover the bills.

On Tuesday, Ms. Retton’s daughter started a fund-raising campaign on social media for her mother, who she said was hospitalized with a rare pneumonia.

“We ask that if you could help in any way, that 1) you PRAY! and 2) if you could help us with finances for the hospital bill,” McKenna Kelley, Ms. Retton’s daughter, wrote in a post on Spotfund, a crowdfunding platform similar to GoFundMe.

The public swiftly responded, with thousands donating $350,000 in less than two days, shattering the goal of $50,000.

The United States has the highest health care prices in the world. Each year, a quarter of a million Americans start crowdfunding campaigns to pay medical bills. The Spotfund post for Ms. Retton, 55, did not share many details about her costs but noted that she did not have health insurance. (When another one of Ms. Retton’s daughters, Shayla Kelley Schrepfer, was reached by text, she did not respond to a question about why her mother was uninsured.)

Unlike Ms. Retton, most patients do not meet their fund-raising goals. About 16 percent of the time, studies have found, crowdfunding campaigns generate no donations at all.

About half of Americans report difficulty paying their medical bills, according to a 2022 Kaiser Family Foundation survey. The problem tends to be particularly acute among the 27.5 million Americans who do not have health insurance.

Most uninsured Americans have low incomes and about two-thirds say they cannot afford to buy coverage. Some earn slightly too much for Obamacare’s subsidies or say that, even with the financial assistance, the premiums are still too expensive.

Last year, Nora Kenworthy, an associate professor at the University of Washington Bothell, published the largest study to date of medical crowdfunding, which analyzed nearly a half-million GoFundMe campaigns. Her work showed that the typical fund-raiser generates about $1,970, falling far short of the $5,000 to $10,000 patients are typically seeking. The most successful campaign in her data set raised $2.4 million, but such high numbers were rare. Fewer than 12 percent of campaigns met their goals.

“What is concealed in viral campaigns like this one is that the vast majority of crowdfunding efforts earn much smaller amounts of money,” Dr. Kenworthy said. “As competition in this marketplace expands, the rates of success are being driven lower.”

GoFundMe offers tips on how to make campaigns successful, suggesting that campaigns include “high-quality images” of the person in need and that they share “the financial, physical, and emotional troubles” that patients are experiencing.

A growing body of research, however, suggests that much of a crowdfunding campaign’s success boils down to factors outside a patient’s control, including race and income, and that crowdfunding often directs resources to those who need them the least.

A 2022 study of cancer patients’ fund-raisers found that those run by patients in poor neighborhoods tended to raise the least money, leading the authors to conclude that “online crowdfunding may exacerbate socioeconomic disparities in cancer care.”

Poorer patients may struggle to generate donations because of bias against them as lazy or undeserving of help, said Jeremy Snyder, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada and the author of a book on the ethics of crowdfunding.

And richer patients are often boosted by their social networks. “If you have a lot of wealthy friends, or live in a wealthy community, those are a lot more people who can potentially donate,” Dr. Snyder said.

Racial and gender disparities also exist in crowdfunding. Dr. Kenworthy and her colleagues analyzed what makes a GoFundMe successful by looking at the 827 highest performing campaigns. She found that young white men coping with unexpected medical crises tend to attract the most support, while Black women were underrepresented among successful campaigns."
"Hoosen Coovadia, Medical Force in South Africa’s H.I.V. Fight, Dies at 83
An esteemed pediatrician, he overcame apartheid’s barriers to help make his country a global leader in H.I.V. care and research.

Hoosen Coovadia, a pediatrician who used science to fight for racial justice in apartheid South Africa and later transformed the approach to H.I.V. treatment for pregnant women in Africa and beyond, died on Oct. 4 at his home in Durban. He was 83.

His daughter, Anuschka Coovadia, a physician in South Africa, confirmed the death, saying he had been in poor health for two years and was further debilitated by a case of Covid-19 several months ago that kept him in intensive care for weeks.

Dr. Jerry Coovadia, as he was familiarly known, was a leader in the struggle against white rule in South Africa and campaigned for decades for the political transition that brought the African National Congress to power in 1994.

But when, four years later, President Thabo Mbeki began to deny that the human immunodeficiency virus caused AIDS, and asserted that new treatments for H.I.V. were poisons he would not permit to be given to South Africans, Dr. Coovadia became one of the government’s fiercest critics.

“Never was a doctor so vilified as Jerry Coovadia in the A.N.C. for his implacable and quietly militant stand against Thabo Mbeki,” said Zackie Achmat, the founder of the Treatment Action Campaign, a movement of people living with H.I.V. that also battled Mr. Mbeki, who was unseated in a party putsch in 2008.

Dr. Coovadia and the activists he supported eventually won that fight, and he helped make South Africa a global leader in H.I.V. care and research. He also mended some relationships with the government, although he remained a vocal critic of inequity in the post-apartheid years.

In a statement after Dr. Coovadia’s death, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said, “Our nation’s loss will be felt globally, but we can take pride at and comfort from the emergence of a giant of science and an icon of compassion and resilience from our country.”

Hoosen Mahomed Coovadia was born on Aug. 2, 1940, in Durban. His parents, Mohamed Coovadia and Khateja Moosa, came from prosperous merchant families in Durban’s Indian community, though his father, a compulsive gambler, lost most of his wealth while Dr. Coovadia was still young.

He was admitted to the University of Natal medical college, set up by the apartheid government for Black and so-called colored students like Dr. Coovadia, but after a short time he concluded that the education it offered was inferior. He applied to study in Cape Town, but the government denied him the permit to travel that he required as a nonwhite student.

Instead, he traveled to India and enrolled at Grant Medical College in Bombay (now Mumbai). There he was exposed to anticolonial ideas and met other South African students, with whom he organized a political association. Prominent leaders of the anti-apartheid movement visiting India would address them.

Dr. Coovadia, with a medical degree from Grant, returned to South Africa in 1966. Three years later, he married Zubeida Hamed, who had also graduated from Grant and was finishing her training in dermatology. Dr. Hamed shared her new husband’s growing interest in activism, and their home, in Durban, became a mecca for political meetings. Dr. Coovadia went to work as a pediatrician at King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban, an institution that could treat only nonwhite South Africans under apartheid, and later joined the department of pediatrics at the University of Natal Medical School (now part of the University of KwaZulu-Natal). He came under suspicion by the regime for conducting research on topics such as racial disparities in infant mortality in South Africa. He also joined the Natal Indian Congress, an anti-apartheid organization, and soon became a leader of it.

In 1975, Dr. Coovadia earned a master’s degree in immunology from the University of Birmingham in Britain. Returning to South Africa, he found opposition to apartheid there swelling into open revolt. He helped found the United Democratic Front, a coalition of more than 400 trade unions, religious organizations and other civic groups opposed to white rule. In 1989, the police raided and ransacked his home in search of papers related to secret talks between the regime and the A.N.C.

A month later, South African secret police planted a bomb in front of Dr. Coovadia’s home. His son, Imraan, a novelist and professor of creative writing at the University of Cape Town, said his father had become such a prominent critic of apartheid abroad, speaking at scientific meetings, that the regime had decided to eliminate him. The bomb destroyed the second floor of the house, but the family survived.

“It took weeks to get the walls rebuilt,” his daughter, Anuschka, said, “and during that time, my father’s medical students came on a schedule, protecting the house with broom poles and sticks, sitting out all night. There was so much love from his community of students.”

In addition to his son and daughter, he is survived by his wife and five grandchildren.

Dr. Coovadia wrote a textbook on child health now in its seventh edition, mentored dozens of students and researchers, many of whom became health ministers and key figures in global health, and conducted pioneering work on measles and pediatric kidney disorders. He advised successive South African governments from various positions, including a seat on the powerful National Planning Commission; led international research projects; published widely in scientific journals; and received awards, including the Star of South Africa, the country’s highest honor, presented by President Nelson Mandela.

But it was his work on H.I.V. that had perhaps the greatest impact on global policy, and which drew him into an unexpectedly vicious political battle.

In the late 1980s, he started to see babies with H.I.V. arriving at the hospital, prompting him to begin researching ways to stop the transmission of the virus from mothers to their children. “He considered it another form of oppression for these women, who were Black, who were poor, who were often rural — and on top of all of that, had H.I.V.,” said Salim Abdool Karim, a leading authority on H.I.V. globally and a former student of Dr. Coovadia’s.

By the 1990s, the World Health Organization was recommending that women with H.I.V. feed their children with baby formula rather than breast milk, which could transmit the virus. But Dr. Coovadia suspected — and then proved in a series of studies — that the risk was minimal in exclusively breastfed infants, and that the health benefits for infants whose mothers did not have access to clean water with which to mix formula far outweighed the risk from H.I.V.

Dr. Coovadia battled the W.H.O. and succeeded in having the policy reversed. He also helped demonstrate that giving antiretroviral drugs to pregnant women could prevent them from transmitting the virus to babies at birth.

South Africa had the world’s largest number of people living with the virus by the late 1990s, but when President Mbeki, to whom Dr. Coovadia had earlier been close, created a commission to govern the AIDS response, he stacked it with rogue researchers and self-proclaimed experts known as “AIDS denialists.” Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, a health minister appointed by Mr. Mbeki, told people living with H.I.V. that they could stave off AIDS by eating garlic and beets. Dr. Coovadia was incensed.

In 2000, as he prepared to become a co-chair of a major global AIDS conference in Durban, the A.N.C. government put immense pressure on him to present the denialist view.

“He was such a courageous and principled person: He would not give in,” said Dr. Peter Piot, who was then the head of the United Nations AIDS agency and who joined Dr. Coovadia in “turbulent” meetings with government officials ahead of the event.

President Mbeki, as head of state, opened the conference and, to the horror of much of the audience, reiterated his denialist view. The government then demanded that Dr. Coovadia allow Dr. Tshabalala-Msimang to close the event.

Dr. Coovadia’s daughter recalled that 10 “thuggish” men came to the family’s hotel room the night before the conference ended and ordered him to a meeting with the minister. “When he came back, he was utterly shaken,” she said. “He didn’t sleep that night.”

Knowing it might mean both the end of his professional life and ostracism from the party for which he had fought for decades, Dr. Coovadia nevertheless refused the minister the platform. Instead, the keynote speaker at the final session was Mr. Mandela, who had stepped down as president a few years earlier. He exhorted the world to bring AIDS treatment to his country and the rest of Africa.

After Mr. Mbeki left office, Dr. Coovida helped South Africa roll out what became the world’s largest H.I.V.- treatment programs."
"Younger Women Are Getting Lung Cancer at Higher Rates Than Men
Researchers are struggling to understand what is driving the gender disparity in lung cancer cases among people 35 to 54.

Over the last several decades, the rates of new cases of lung cancer have fallen in the United States. There were roughly 65 new cases of lung cancer for every 100,000 people in 1992. By 2019, that number had dropped to about 42.

But for all that progress, a disparity is emerging: Women between the ages of 35 and 54 are being diagnosed with lung cancer at higher rates than men in that same age group, according to a report published Thursday by researchers at the American Cancer Society. The disparity is small — one or two more cases among every 100,000 women in that age range than among men — but it is significant enough that researchers want to know more.

The report adds to a mounting body of evidence that emphasizes the lung cancer risks for women in particular.

Overall, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that, nationwide, around 197,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year.

There’s a common perception that lung cancer occurs only in older men who have smoked for decades, said Dr. Narjust Florez, a thoracic medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. But, every day, she said, hundreds of women are “dying of lung cancer in this country.”

What do we know about lung cancer disparities?
Researchers are trying to make sense of why lung cancer rates are higher among younger women, as well as the best way to help patients. But there aren’t definitive answers.

While lung cancer is still far more common in older patients, some doctors say they’re seeing more and more younger patients with the disease, even if they are not smokers — another puzzle they’re working to understand.

Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer, and while there have been widespread efforts to reduce smoking, women have generally been slower to successfully quit, said Ahmedin Jemal, senior vice president of surveillance and health equity science at the American Cancer Society and an author on the new study.

But about 15 to 20 percent of lung cancer cases in women are among those who have never smoked, he said. It’s tricky to tease out why these women develop the disease. They may be exposed to secondhand smoke. Or women might metabolize carcinogens differently from the way men do, said Dr. Jyoti Patel, medical director of thoracic oncology at the Lurie Cancer Center at Northwestern Medicine.

Environmental exposures could also play a role. Air pollution has been linked to lung cancer, and it’s possible that women could be particularly susceptible to it, for reasons researchers are still working to understand, said Dr. Patrick Forde, an associate professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.

Additionally, the C.D.C. cites radon — an invisible, naturally occurring gas that can build up in some homes — as the second leading cause of lung cancer. But data on residential radon exposure is mixed, Dr. Florez said.

Ultimately, there is no clear-cut explanation for the disparities. “The differences are really not obvious,” said Dr. Humberto Choi, a pulmonary medicine doctor at the Cleveland Clinic. “This is definitely an area for future studies.”

What are the early signs of lung cancer? And who should get screened?
In 2021, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force broadened its lung cancer screening recommendation: Anyone ages 50 to 80 who smoked at least a pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years or more, and who currently smokes or who has quit within the last 15 years, should get a CT scan annually. Medicare and most insurance plans fully cover this screening.

Still, less than half of those eligible actually get screened, said Dr. Charu Aggarwal, a lung cancer specialist at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center. That may be because of barriers to access, stigma associated with lung cancer or fear of what a screening may find.

Gender bias can also affect testing, Dr. Florez said. Women, and particularly women of color, are less likely to be offered tests for lung cancer, she said.

“I have women that have come with chest pressure and leave the office with Xanax,” she said. “And then when they start coughing up blood, that’s when somebody listens to them.”

In light of the disparities, experts urged women to get screened if they qualify. If you have a close family history of lung cancer not associated with smoking, you should also talk to your doctor about evaluating your cancer risk, Dr. Forde said.

And everyone should be aware of symptoms of lung cancer. Lung cancer is typically not detected until it is late stage, Dr. Forde said: partly because the symptoms go underrecognized, and partly because screening is underused. Early signs can include a cough that lasts for longer than six weeks, upper back pain, shortness of breath and unexplained weight loss, Dr. Florez said. Some people may also develop a hoarse voice; in severe cases, they may cough up blood, Dr. Patel said.

“We’re seeing the demographics change,” Dr. Patel said. “People shouldn’t ignore symptoms that could lead to lung cancer diagnosis.”

"The Average Human Body Temperature Is Not 98.6 Degrees
Here’s why we appear to be getting cooler, and what that could mean when it comes to fevers.

Over the past few decades, evidence has been mounting that the average human body temperature is not really 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Instead, most people’s baseline is a little bit cooler.

The standard of 98.6 was established over 150 years ago by the German physician Dr. Carl Wunderlich, who reportedly took over a million measurements from 25,000 people. Temperatures ranged from 97.2 to 99.5, and the average was 98.6. Dr. Wunderlich also established 100.4 degrees as “probably febrile.”

However, a study published in September that evaluated the temperatures of more than 126,000 people between 2008 and 2017 found that the average is closer to 97.9 degrees. Other modern-day studies have reported similar numbers.

Experts who study body temperature have differing opinions about why we appear to have gotten cooler over time, and whether that matters when it comes to evaluating fevers and diagnosing infections.

Why 98.6 is off base
Some researchers say it could just be a measurement issue — Dr. Wunderlich might have assessed temperatures using different methods and standards than we do today. One account reports that he used a foot-long thermometer that went into a person’s armpit.

Many factors can influence a body temperature reading, the most significant being where you take it: Rectal temperatures are reliably higher than oral temperatures, which are reliably higher than readings taken from the skin. Body temperature is also influenced by the time of day, whether it’s hot or cold outside and even whether the person just had something to eat or drink. Readings can also vary from thermometer to thermometer, depending on how they are calibrated.

Comparing historical and modern-day data gives you “a hodgepodge mixture of observations,” said Dr. Philip Mackowiak, an emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who, in a 1992 paper, was one of the first researchers to scrutinize Dr. Wunderlich’s conclusions. The drop in temperature may be “a true phenomenon,” he added, “but there’s no way of knowing because the data are so varied.”

Other experts think humans really have gotten cooler over the past 150 years. Our temperatures may have declined because “we are so lucky to be healthier than we used to be,” said Dr. Julie Parsonnet, a professor of medicine and of epidemiology and population health at Stanford Medicine, who led the September study on body temperature.

For instance, it could be that many people in Dr. Wunderlich’s sample had slightly elevated temperatures from low-grade inflammation. Better treatment of infections, improved dental care and the development and use of medications like statins and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may all have contributed to a decline in inflammation since the 19th century, which in turn lowered people’s average temperature, Dr. Parsonnet said.

Regardless of the reason for the shift, the experts interviewed for this article agreed that 98.6 degrees should no longer be considered the universal human standard. But instead of shifting the average temperature down a degree or so, it should be given as a range, said Dr. Waleed Javaid, a professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who published a 2019 review paper on body temperature.

A range would account for the natural variability in temperature that occurs across gender and age — women tend to run slightly warmer than men, and older adults run cooler than younger people. Additionally, everyone’s body temperature fluctuates throughout the day — it is typically lowest in the morning and highest in the late afternoon.

“Like there’s a range for heart rate, there’s a range for blood pressure,” temperature also has a range, Dr. Javaid said.

What counts as a fever
If we redefine “normal” human body temperature, then what registers as abnormal?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that temperatures of 100.4 and above qualify as a fever — a roughly two-degree increase from 98.6. But if the average human temperature is lower, it’s possible that the temperature indicating a fever could be lower, as well.

Dr. Parsonnet would like to see a personalized approach to fever, where doctors compare each patient against their own baseline so that low-grade fevers aren’t missed in people who run cooler. The mission is somewhat personal for her: Dr. Parsonnet’s mother-in-law has a heart infection that went undiagnosed for months because she never registered as being feverish. Her temperature was around 98.6, but, Dr. Parsonnet said, that “was not normal for her, for her age.”

To Dr. Mackowiak, this individualized approach would be ideal, but it’s unrealistic given the time constraints doctors and nurses are already under.

He and Dr. Javaid are also not as concerned about the possibility of low-grade fevers being missed because of the current temperature standards. Instead of changing the definition of a fever, they said the solution may be to place less of an emphasis on fever overall, and to think of it as one sign among many — something that many doctors already do. (This advice applies to parents, as well as physicians.)

If a temperature is sky-high, that’s important information, Dr. Javaid said, but “the temperature is not the only thing one should look at.”"
"F.D.A. Issues Warning Over Misuse of Ketamine
Unsupervised treatment — fueled by telemedicine prescriptions — for various psychiatric problems poses a number of health risks, the agency said.

The Food and Drug Administration issued an alert on Tuesday about the dangers of treating psychiatric disorders with compounded versions of ketamine, a powerful anesthetic that has become increasingly popular among those seeking alternative therapies for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other difficult-to-treat mental health problems.

Compounded drugs are those that have been modified or tailored in a lab for the specific needs of an individual patient.

The agency, citing reports it had received of adverse incidents, warned that the unsupervised use of compounded ketamine heightened the risk of dangerous psychiatric reactions and health problems like increased blood pressure, respiratory depression and urinary tract issues that can lead to incontinence.

The warning sought to differentiate between the supervised use of ketamine as a psychiatric therapy administered at clinics and “wellness centers,” and online marketers who prescribe the drug via telemedicine so that buyers can take the drug at home.

“Patients who receive compounded ketamine products from compounders and telemedicine platforms for the treatment of psychiatric disorders may not receive important information about the potential risks associated with the product,” the F.D.A. said in its warning.

With the exception of esketamine, a federally approved ketamine nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression, the psychiatric use of ketamine is unapproved and unregulated, though so-called off-label use of ketamine is not illegal.

Since it was first approved as a battlefield anesthetic in 1970, ketamine has also gained popularity as Special K, a club drug that is usually snorted. More recently, there has been an explosion in injected ketamine-assisted therapy, much of it fueled by a small but growing body of research reporting breakthroughs among patients with hard-to-treat mental health problems.

But the regulatory vacuum has also opened the door to mounting abuse. Ketamine can be addictive, and heavy, long-term use can lead to significant health problems, including irreversible urinary tract damage.

The pandemic-related boom in telehealth has given rise to a legion of online prescribers that dispense inexpensive ketamine lozenges, tablets or nasal sprays following a brief video interview. Some companies provide as many as 30 doses after one session, which experts say can lead to misuse.

“Whenever you have something new, there may be people who run ahead with it. And there will be people who do things based on less evidence rather than more,” said Dr. Joshua Berman, medical director for interventional psychiatry at Columbia University, who helped develop the department’s ketamine program.

Executives in the pharmaceutical compounding industry said they welcomed government oversight but expressed concern that a lack of nuance in the F.D.A.’s guidance could lead to overzealous crackdowns by state regulators, who have jurisdiction over the nation’s compounding facilities.

“Our concern is that these online sellers are going to ruin it for everybody,” said Peter Koshland, who runs a compounding pharmacy in San Francisco. “Our fear is that regulators, if they perceive a threat to public health, will move to take this amazing medicine away and leave patients at risk.”

The F.D.A. alert did not include data about adverse reactions among ketamine users. It cited a single case from April of a patient with post-traumatic stress disorder who experienced respiratory depression after taking compounded oral ketamine outside of a health care setting. The patient’s ketamine blood level, the agency said, was twice the amount typically used in anesthesia.

The F.D.A. declined to make an official available for an interview.

Dr. Steven Radowitz, chief medical officer at Nushama, a ketamine clinic in New York City that administers the drug via injection, said he hoped the alert would help patients differentiate between companies that sell the drug online and those whose treatments are accompanied by strict supervision. At Nushama, he said, the treatment protocol includes six ketamine treatments over the course of three weeks, and an in-house staff that includes doctors, nurse practitioners and therapists.

“No one goes home with ketamine,” Dr. Radowitz said. “And that’s the way it should be.”

"New A.I. Tool Diagnoses Brain Tumors on the Operating Table
A new study describes a method for faster and more precise diagnoses, which can help surgeons decide how aggressively to operate.

Once their scalpels reach the edge of a brain tumor, surgeons are faced with an agonizing decision: cut away some healthy brain tissue to ensure the entire tumor is removed, or give the healthy tissue a wide berth and risk leaving some of the menacing cells behind.

Now scientists in the Netherlands report using artificial intelligence to arm surgeons with knowledge about the tumor that may help them make that choice.

The method, described in a study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, involves a computer scanning segments of a tumor’s DNA and alighting on certain chemical modifications that can yield a detailed diagnosis of the type and even subtype of the brain tumor.

That diagnosis, generated during the early stages of an hours-long surgery, can help surgeons decide how aggressively to operate, the researchers said. In the future, the method may also help steer doctors toward treatments tailored for a specific subtype of tumor.

“It’s imperative that the tumor subtype is known at the time of surgery,” said Jeroen de Ridder, an associate professor in the Center for Molecular Medicine at UMC Utrecht, a Dutch hospital, who helped lead the study. “What we have now uniquely enabled is to allow this very fine-grained, robust, detailed diagnosis to be performed already during the surgery.”

Their deep learning system, called Sturgeon, was first tested on frozen tumor samples from previous brain cancer operations. It accurately diagnosed 45 of 50 cases within 40 minutes of starting genetic sequencing. In the other five cases, it refrained from offering a diagnosis because the information was unclear.

The system was then tested during 25 live brain surgeries, most of them on children, alongside the standard method of examining tumor samples under a microscope. The new approach delivered 18 correct diagnoses and failed to reach the needed confidence threshold in the other seven cases. It turned around its diagnoses in less than 90 minutes, the study reported — short enough for it to inform decisions during an operation.

Currently, in addition to examining brain tumor samples under a microscope, doctors can send them for more thorough genetic sequencing.

But not every hospital has access to that technology. And even for those that do, it can take several weeks to receive results, said Dr. Alan Cohen, the director of the Johns Hopkins Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery and a cancer specialist.

“We have to start treatment without knowing what we’re treating,” Dr. Cohen said.

The new method uses a faster genetic sequencing technique and applies it only to a small slice of the cellular genome, allowing it to return results before a surgeon has started operating on the edges of a tumor.

Dr. de Ridder said that the model was powerful enough to deliver a diagnosis with sparse genetic data, akin to someone recognizing an image based on only one percent of its pixels, and from an unknown portion of the image.

“It can figure out itself what it’s looking at and make a robust classification,” said Dr. de Ridder, who is also a principal investigator at Oncode Institute, a cancer research center in the Netherlands.

But some tumors are still difficult to diagnose. The samples taken during surgery are about the size of a kernel of corn, and if they include some healthy brain tissue, the deep learning system may struggle to pick out enough tumor-specific markers.

In the study, doctors dealt with that by asking the pathologists examining samples under a microscope to flag the ones with the most tumor for sequencing, said Marc Pagès-Gallego, a bioinformatician at UMC Utrecht and a co-author of the study.

There can also be differences within a single patient’s tumor cells, meaning that the small segment being sequenced may not be representative of the entire tumor. Some less common tumors may not correspond to those that have previously been classified. And some tumor types are easier to classify than others.

Other medical centers have already started applying the new method to surgical samples, the study’s authors said, suggesting that it can work in other people’s hands.

But Dr. Sebastian Brandner, a professor of neuropathology at University College London, said that sequencing and classifying tumor cells often still required significant expertise in bioinformatics as well as workers who are able to run, troubleshoot and repair the technology.

“Implementation itself is less straightforward than often suggested,” he said.

Brain tumors are also the most well-suited to being classified by the chemical modifications that the new method analyzes; not all cancers can be diagnosed that way.

The new method is part of a broad movement toward bringing molecular precision to diagnosing tumors, potentially allowing scientists to develop targeted treatments that are less damaging to the nervous system. But translating a deeper knowledge of tumors to new therapies has proved difficult.

“We’ve made some gains,” Dr. Cohen said, “but not as many in the treatment as in the understanding of the molecular profile of the tumors.”"
"Illicit E-Cigarettes Flood Stores as F.D.A. Struggles to Combat Imports
Some vapes are appearing with increasing nicotine levels that approach those in a carton of cigarettes. U.S. regulators did not authorize them, but have failed to keep them off shelves.

Juul was once the cool vape, blamed for hooking teenagers on e-cigarettes, and it is set to pay billions of dollars in legal settlements.

Then came Puff Bar, which was hot in high schools until federal officials began impounding those vapes. Elf Bar stepped in, and its products have been seized at the border. A parade of facsimiles is moving in right behind them: Virtue Bar, Juicy Bar, Lost Mary, Lost Vape and many more.

The latest flood of illicit e-cigarettes is arriving from China in Barbiecore colors and fruit, ice cream and slushy flavors, and accounts for a major share of the estimated $5.5 billion e-cigarette market in the United States.

The never-ending influx of vapes, some offering 5,000 or more puffs per device or escalating nicotine levels, has exposed a gaping lapse in enforcement by the Food and Drug Administration, which has authorized only a handful of the hundreds of options that line convenience store walls nationwide. Members of Congress, two dozen state attorneys general and even the Big Tobacco companies have stepped up their calls for the agency to get the situation under control.

Granted, the latest pleas by the tobacco industry are viewed by antismoking groups as a cringe-worthy effort to lock down market share, but some others interpret the addition of these odd bedfellows as a sign of a market run amok.

The F.D.A. “has been dealt a very difficult hand, and a lot of which includes putting the genie back — or stuffing the genie back — in the bottle,” said Erika Sward, assistant vice president of advocacy for the American Lung Association. “And I don’t envy them for that.”

Agency officials said they had used every tool within their authority to crack down on e-cigarette outlaws. Yet recent fines issued by the agency topped out at about $19,000 per violation and largely targeted a few products sold at each store. The agency’s orders telling six manufacturers to stop selling certain products were directed at U.S. stores, some of which were in small cities.

And though the F.D.A. has fired off hundreds of warning letters, the effect is barely felt: Flavored vape sales have surged 60 percent over the past three years, to 18 million vaping products a month in June from 11 million a month in early 2020, according to the C.D.C. Foundation.

“The F.D.A. should not be having any of these flavored e-cigarettes on the market,” said Yolonda Richardson, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “And so it just needs to do its job.”

When the F.D.A. received expanded authority to regulate e-cigarettes in 2016, the objective was to draw a new line in public health: Smokers would have an alternative to traditional cigarettes, and tobacco use among minors would remain at historic lows.

More on Smoking, Vaping and E-Cigarettes
Menthol Ban: The Biden administration delayed a decision about whether it would ban menthol cigarettes amid mounting opposition from tobacco companies and Black activists worried about police enforcement.
Smoking Bans: France unveiled a plan to ban smoking on beaches, near schools and in parks, while New Zealand’s new right-wing government has said it will repeal a law that would have made tobacco illegal.
A Gen Z Makeover: In candy shades and eggy shapes, many of today’s most popular vaping devices have a playful appearance. Experts worry they will hook a new generation of users.
A Viral Brand?: You can’t buy Hestia cigarettes at any bodega or tobacco shop in New York. But the company is getting its smokes into the hands of “cigfluencers.”
Seven years on, nearly 40 percent of e-cigarette users are 25 or younger, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And of the 2,000 or so vaping and e-cigarette products on the market, the agency has only given the green light to about two dozen of them, and it still has to deal with a backlog of applications, according to research on the industry.

There are few places where the problem feels more pressing than in high school bathrooms, where students crowd the stalls between classes to get a nicotine fix.

Teenage vaping rates have fallen roughly by half since their height during the Juul craze of 2019, to about 14 percent of high school students last year from nearly 28 percent at their peak, federal surveys show. Those rates were based on survey responses in which students said whether they had vaped within the past 30 days.

Kyle Wimmer, an art teacher at Mountain Range High School, north of Denver, frequently hears from students dealing with nicotine addiction from e-cigarette use.

He accepts discarded vapes and helps young people turn them into art. And as a teacher who has been open about his past struggles with alcohol, he’s also there to listen.

“It’s hard to tell kids not to do this when they’re hooked because they can’t just stop,” Mr. Wimmer said, adding: “They’re having troubles. They’re struggling.”

A growing body of research shows that while vapes may not be as toxic as cigarettes, they are far from healthy, particularly for adolescents who become addicted to nicotine while their brains are still developing.

The American Heart Association has raised the alarm about possible cardiovascular effects from e-cigarettes and called for more research. One recent meta-analysis reported higher heart attack risks in e-cigarette users than in those who did not vape or smoke anything. (Cigarette smokers had the highest risk.)

In recent years, the market has begun to move toward high-volume vapes advertising 5,000 to 6,000 puffs — with about as much addictive nicotine as is in a carton of cigarettes. The devices come in flavors that could appeal to younger adolescents such as birthday shake, gummy bear and watermelon ice, and they have higher concentrations of nicotine than were found before. The prices have also dropped, said Barbara Schillo, chief research officer for the Truth Initiative, who documented the trend in a recent study.

“In other words, these disposable devices are getting bigger, stronger and cheaper,” Dr. Schillo said.

Calls for change have only grown louder. In a letter sent in late August, 30 state attorneys general urged the F.D.A. to do more to deter youth vaping and to ban all but tobacco flavored e-cigarettes.

Lawmakers, including Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and a leading opponent of e-cigarettes, have pushed for action. His office discovered nearly two dozen types of vapes being sold online even after the F.D.A. had denied their marketing applications and sent them warning letters.

“I just don’t understand it,” Senator Durbin said in a floor speech last month, adding that the F.D.A. “is cowardly, refusing to use its full arsenal of enforcement tools — fines, injunctions — for even these most flagrant cases.”

Even R.J. Reynolds, the maker of Newport and Camel cigarettes and the best-selling Vuse vapes, has invoked public health in a petition lodged with the F.D.A. seeking official action. It asked the agency to prioritize enforcement of flavored, disposable vapes.

Luis Pinto, a spokesman for the company, said that devices aimed at young people and minors threatened the efforts of Reynolds and others to convert adult smokers to e-cigarette users. “The whole category is in peril,” he said.

Reynolds’s Vuse e-cigarettes led vaping sales for a year ending in August, Goldman Sachs data shows, with $2.2 billion in sales. The “other” category, which included flavored imports, trailed with $1.6 billion in sales, with Juul close behind.

Brian King, the F.D.A.’s tobacco center chief, said that the agency had ramped up warnings, fines and injunctions on illicit vape makers, sellers and distributors. He rebutted some of the criticism from “the cheap seats” and said enforcement efforts needed to be strategic and methodical.

“It’s a very complex chess match, not a game of tic-tac-toe,” Dr. King said. “And we need to ensure that the actions we take are both scientifically and legally defensible.”

F.D.A. officials meet regularly with Justice Department prosecutors, Dr. King said, describing them as critical partners. The agency has also worked with border authorities to seize imports of Elf Bar and Esco Bar products, he added. In addition, the agency has received funding to begin an effort to closely track the rapidly morphing vape marketplace.

“Nothing’s off the table when it comes to enforcement,” he said.

In late September, the F.D.A. announced 22 fines of $19,192 each against gas stations that received warning letters but did not stop selling Elf Bar products.

The F.D.A. has required e-cigarette makers to file applications to sell their products and to submit proof that the products would be likely to compel cigarette smokers to switch — but not to attract new users. The agency has denied millions of applications and let some top-selling products remain on market pending decisions.

Two years have passed since a court-imposed deadline required the F.D.A. to respond to all applications. Dr. King said it would finalize decisions, including on some Vuse and Juul vapes, by the year’s end.

The lengthy, opaque approval process, marked with legal challenges and defiance of the F.D.A.’s decrees, has opened the door to the shape-shifting influx of unauthorized vapes that come by air, land and sea from factories in China (where flavored vapes are outlawed).

The confusing mix of product statuses has prompted the Energy Marketers of America, an organization representing retailers, including convenience stores linked to gas stations, to file a petition with the F.D.A. seeking clarity about which e-cigarettes the stores can legally sell.

Stores are “well positioned to aid in the fight against illegal and dangerous products by keeping them off their shelves,” according to the petition.

"Scientists Use CRISPR to Make Chickens More Resistant to Bird Flu
A new study highlights both the promise and the limitations of gene editing, as a highly lethal form of avian influenza continues to spread around the world.

Scientists have used the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR to create chickens that have some resistance to avian influenza, according to a new study that was published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday.

The study suggests that genetic engineering could potentially be one tool for reducing the toll of bird flu, a group of viruses that pose grave dangers to both animals and humans. But the study also highlights the limitations and potential risks of the approach, scientists said.

Some breakthrough infections still occurred, especially when gene-edited chickens were exposed to very high doses of the virus, the researchers found. And when the scientists edited just one chicken gene, the virus quickly adapted. The findings suggest that creating flu-resistant chickens will require editing multiple genes and that scientists will need to proceed carefully to avoid driving further evolution of the virus, the study’s authors said.

The research is “proof of concept that we can move toward making chickens resistant to the virus,” Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London and an author of the study, said at a news briefing. “But we’re not there yet.”

Some scientists who were not involved in the research had a different takeaway.

“It’s an excellent study,” said Dr. Carol Cardona, an expert on bird flu and avian health at the University of Minnesota. But to Dr. Cardona, the results illustrate how difficult it will be to engineer a chicken that can stay a step ahead of the flu, a virus known for its ability to evolve swiftly.

“There’s no such thing as an easy button for influenza,” Dr. Cardona said. “It replicates quickly, and it adapts quickly.”

Avian influenza refers to a group of flu viruses that are adapted to spread in birds. Over the last several years, a highly lethal version of a bird flu virus known as H5N1 has spread rapidly around the globe, killing countless farmed and wild birds. It has also repeatedly infected wild mammals and been detected in a small number of people. Although the virus remains adapted to birds, scientists worry that it could acquire mutations that help it spread more easily among humans, potentially setting off a pandemic.

Many nations have tried to stamp out the virus by increasing biosecurity on farms, quarantining infected premises and culling infected flocks. But the virus has become so widespread in wild birds that it has proved impossible to contain, and some nations have begun vaccinating poultry, although that endeavor presents some logistic and economic challenges.

If scientists could engineer resistance into chickens, farmers would not need to routinely vaccinate new batches of birds. Gene editing “promises a new way to make permanent changes in the disease resistance of an animal,” Mike McGrew, an embryologist at the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute and an author of the new study, said at the briefing. “This can be passed down through all the gene-edited animals, to all the offspring.”

CRISPR, the gene-editing technology used in the study, is a molecular tool that allows scientists to make targeted edits in DNA, changing the genetic code at a precise point in the genome. In the new study, the researchers used this approach to tweak a chicken gene that codes for a protein known as ANP32A, which the flu virus hijacks to copy itself. The tweaks were designed to prevent the virus from binding to the protein — and therefore keep it from replicating inside chickens.

The edits did not appear to have negative health consequences for the chickens, the researchers said. “We observed that they were healthy, and that the gene-edited hens also laid eggs normally,” said Dr. Alewo Idoko-Akoh, who conducted the research as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh.

The researchers then sprayed a dose of flu virus into the nasal cavities of 10 chickens that had not been genetically edited, to serve as the control. (The researchers used a mild version of the virus different from the one that has been causing major outbreaks in recent years.) All of the control chickens were infected with the virus, which they then transmitted to other control chickens they were housed with.

When the researchers administered flu virus directly into the nasal cavities of 10 gene-edited chickens, just one of the birds became infected. It had low levels of the virus and did not pass the virus on to other gene-edited birds.

“But having seen that, we felt that it would be the responsible thing to be more rigorous, to stress test this and ask, ‘Are these chickens truly resistant?’” Dr. Barclay said. “‘What if they were to somehow encounter a much, much higher dose?’”

When the scientists gave the gene-edited chickens a flu dose that was 1,000 times higher, half of the birds became infected. The researchers found, however, that they generally shed lower levels of the virus than control chickens exposed to the same high dose.

The researchers then studied samples of the virus from the gene-edited birds that had been infected. These samples had several notable mutations, which appeared to allow the virus to use the edited ANP32A protein to replicate, they found.

Some of these mutations also helped the virus replicate better in human cells, although the researchers noted that those mutations in isolation would not be enough to create a virus that was well adapted to humans.

Seeing those mutations is “not ideal,” said Richard Webby, who is a bird flu expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and was not involved in the research. “But when you get to the weeds of these particular changes, then it doesn’t concern me quite so much.”

The mutated flu virus was also able to replicate even in the complete absence of the ANP32A protein by using two other proteins in the same family, the researchers found. When they created chicken cells that lacked all three of these proteins, the virus was not able to replicate. Those chicken cells were also resistant to the highly lethal version of H5N1 that has been spreading around the world the last several years.

The researchers are now working to create chickens with edits in all three of the genes for the protein family.

The big question, Dr. Webby said, was whether chickens with edits in all three genes would still develop normally and grow as fast as poultry producers needed. But the idea of gene editing chickens had enormous promise, he said. “Absolutely, we’re going to get to a point where we can manipulate the host genome to make them less susceptible to flu,” he said. “That’ll be a win for public health.”"
"How Do My Calorie Needs Change as I Age?
Your body’s need for fuel shifts as you get older. Your eating habits should shift, too.

Q: I’m in my 50s, and I’ve heard that it’s normal to burn fewer calories as I get older. Is this true?

You can think of burning calories as “Step 1 of being alive,” said Herman Pontzer, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. Food gives your body the fuel it needs to stay healthy, he said.

Your age — among several other factors — can have a big effect on how many calories you need to maintain your body’s weight and basic functions, Dr. Pontzer and other experts said.

Here’s what to know.

How your age affects the calories you burn
The size of your body is the most important factor that affects your calorie requirements, Dr. Pontzer said. “The bigger you are, the more calories you need.”

But your life stage is also crucial, he added.

Babies and children, for example, require fewer calories than adults simply because they are smaller. But when you calculate how many calories they use relative to their body size, it’s actually more than what adults use because they are growing and developing, Dr. Pontzer said.

Being more physically active also increases the number of calories you burn, said Anna Maria Siega-Riz, a nutrition professor and the dean of the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She was the lead author of a 2023 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine that estimated the calorie needs of people in the United States and Canada.

According to that report, an inactive, 200-pound, 40-year-old man would need about 2,700 calories per day to maintain his weight and basic bodily functions. But if he were an athlete training for a couple of hours each day, he would need about 3,500 calories per day.

The same report estimated that starting around age 19, calorie requirements “drift down” a bit each year — to the tune of about 11 calories annually for men and seven for women, said Susan Roberts, a senior associate dean of foundational research at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine.

A 170-pound woman who walks for 60 to 80 minutes each day, for example, would need 2,450 calories per day at age 20 — at age 60, however, that would drop to 2,150, and at 80 it would be 2,000.

This age-related drop in calorie burn is usually most noticeable in your 60s and beyond, Dr. Roberts said, possibly manifesting in weight gain or a less robust appetite. As you age, you tend to lose muscle and gain fat, which burns fewer calories, she said. And your brain — the body’s most metabolically active tissue — naturally shrinks in size and requires less energy, she added.

It’s also common for people to become less physically active as they age, further reducing the number of calories they burn each day, Dr. Siega-Riz said.

You can estimate your own calorie requirements using an online calculator. Just keep in mind that such calculators can provide only a general picture of what you should consume. Your actual needs will vary according to your daily activities, genetics and other factors, Dr. Siega-Riz said.

If you’re wondering whether you’re consuming the right amount, the best way to check is to weigh yourself every so often, Dr. Siega-Riz said. If your weight is relatively stable, then you’re eating an appropriate number of calories.

But for some people, a hyper-focus on the scale can create or worsen anxieties about food and weight, Dr. Siega-Riz said, so weigh yourself only as often as you’re comfortable.

What burning fewer calories means for your eating habits
The good news is that you probably won’t need to do much calorie counting as you age, because your appetite should naturally ebb to match your needs, Dr. Pontzer said.

But as you get older, it’s important to make sure you’re getting the right balance of nutrients, Dr. Roberts said.

For instance, research suggests that beginning in your 50s, your body needs more of certain nutrients such as calcium, vitamin B6, vitamin D and protein, even though you’re likely eating fewer daily calories overall.

Because of that, Dr. Siega-Riz said, you’ll need to dedicate more of your daily calorie budget to foods that give you a bigger bang for your buck nutrient-wise, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean sources of protein.

Dr. Roberts agreed. When you’re in your 20s and 30s, she said, “you can still have calories left over for chocolate or beer or a piece of cake.” But if you’re in your 80s and consuming only about 1,500 calories per day, there’s less room for treats, she said.

Dr. Roberts thinks it’s wise for older adults to take a multivitamin supplement to help fill in any nutritional gaps. But even then, a good diet is still necessary to ensure you’re getting other important nutrients like protein, fiber and healthful plant-based compounds, she said."
"Her Insurance Refused to Pay for Wegovy, So She Sued
Many employers and government programs won’t cover costly obesity medications. A lawsuit is challenging one such policy.

Jeannette Simonton was a textbook candidate for the obesity drug Wegovy when her doctor prescribed it to her in February.

At 5 feet 2 inches and 228 pounds, she had a body mass index of nearly 42 — well above the cutoff U.S. regulators had approved for eligibility for the medication. She also had serious joint problems after decades of struggling with her weight.

But her insurance refused to pay for the medication, citing a blanket ban on covering weight-loss drugs, according to a letter Ms. Simonton received in March from her benefits administrator.

Now, Ms. Simonton is suing the Washington State agency that purchases health insurance for public employees like her. Her lawyers argue that the state’s health plans are discriminating against Ms. Simonton — and others who, like her, are seeking weight-loss drugs — in violation of state law, which recognizes obesity as a type of disability.

Ms. Simonton’s case is a flashpoint in the conflict over whether health insurance should have to cover obesity drugs. The challenge for payers is that the medications would be hugely costly if they were broadly covered in the United States, where more than 100 million people are obese.

The lawsuit is likely to be closely watched as a test of whether health plans can refuse to pay for obesity drugs. Ms. Simonton is being represented by a Seattle law firm, Sirianni Youtz Spoonemore Hamburger, that has a long track record of challenging health insurance restrictions, including those for costly hepatitis C cures.

Wegovy and other appetite-suppressing drugs are in huge demand because they are stunningly effective in helping patients lose weight. But the scale of that demand would pose an unprecedented financial burden for the employers and government programs that shoulder most of the costs of prescription drugs. Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s high-dose version of its popular drug Ozempic, has a sticker price of over $16,000 a year.

A Close Look at Weight Loss Drugs
Teenage Obesity: Twenty-two percent of adolescents age 12 to 19 have obesity. But pediatricians are hesitant to prescribe medicines like Wegovy, citing their newness and uncertainties around them.
Menopausal Weight Gain: Some women going through menopause are seeking drugs like Ozempic to help with excess weight. Experts worry about the risks, but some doctors are beginning to oblige.
A Striking Benefit: A pivotal new study suggests that the weight loss drug Wegovy cut the risk of heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular issues by 20% among overweight or obese people with heart disease.
Reshaping Denmark’s Economy: Novo Nordisk, the Danish company behind Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug also used by some people for weight loss, is reaping huge profits and is now responsible for most of the country’s economic growth.
Side Effects: Diabetes treatments that are used to lose weight can reduce people’s desire to drink alcohol and their obsessive thinking about food. The drugs also carry serious risks, including malnutrition and facial aging.
More payers have recently begun covering the obesity medications, encouraged by research suggesting that the drugs may pay for themselves in the long run by improving patients’ health. But others say they simply cannot afford to cover the medications.

Ms. Simonton, 57, a nurse who is well versed on the health benefits of the drugs, said she saw the refusal to cover her Wegovy as shortsighted.

“They’re being penny wise and pound foolish,” she said. “What will they be paying in 10, 15 years if I don’t continue to lose the weight?”

The agency Ms. Simonton is suing, the Washington State Health Care Authority, declined to comment. Ms. Simonton gets her health insurance through the public hospital where she works. As part of her compensation, her hospital pays premiums to the state, which the Health Care Authority uses to pay for her health plan. The agency has authority over which drugs are covered.

Wegovy is in a class of injectable drugs known as GLP-1s, named after the natural hormone whose effects they emulate. The drugs have been used for years to treat Type 2 diabetes but more recently have been recognized for their extraordinary power to slash body weight.

About 36 million people with Type 2 diabetes in the United States — as well as about 18 million who are obese but not diabetic — have access to GLP-1s through their health plans, according to analysts at the investment bank Jefferies. That is about 17 percent of the country’s insured people.

Federal law prohibits Medicare from paying for drugs for weight loss, a ban that persists largely because of the staggering costs. If Congress were to overturn the ban, one projection from academic researchers estimates, two million Medicare beneficiaries — 10 percent of older people with obesity — would take Wegovy. In that case, the government’s annual expenditure would be $27 billion, nearly a fifth of the yearly spending for Medicare’s Part D program covering prescription drugs taken at home.

Employers and state health insurance programs for public employees face a similar dilemma. In Arkansas, where 40 percent of people on the plan for state employees have obesity, covering the drugs would cost $83 million annually. The Wisconsin program would have to come up with an additional $25 million annually.

“Employers don’t suddenly have a new pot of money to pay for higher health insurance premiums,” said Dr. Steven Pearson, president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses the value of medicines. “We’re talking about big changes to companies’ ability to provide other benefits, wage increases, new hires, and they may also have to turn that into higher premiums for their own employees.”

Another worry for employers is that they may not reap the savings of investing in weight-loss medications. Averted heart attacks and avoided hospital stays made possible by the drugs may not manifest in savings until years down the line, when a patient has left that employer.

But advocates for patients with obesity see stigma and bias at play when health plans view weight-loss treatment as akin to unnecessary vanity procedures.

Ms. Simonton, who lives in Ellensburg, Wash., has had obesity for as long as she can remember. At one point in her 40s, she weighed 424 pounds. After she underwent an operation to reduce the size of her stomach, her weight fluctuated for years above 250 pounds.

The weight has taken a toll. With osteoarthritis so bad that the bones in her knees were rubbing against one another, she has already had her right knee replaced and has surgery for her left scheduled for next month. “I wondered if I was going to have a nursing career left,” she said.

Last year, she started taking Mounjaro, another powerful GLP-1 medication, with most of her costs covered by the drug’s manufacturer, Eli Lilly. When that assistance ran out, she paused treatment while her doctors helped her seek insurance coverage for the Novo Nordisk drug.

In February, frustrated by the lack of progress, Ms. Simonton began paying out of pocket to obtain a version of the Novo Nordisk medication from a compounding pharmacy.

Since she started taking GLP-1 drugs in September 2022, she has lost 76 pounds. She now weighs 191 pounds.

“My life has changed, in an amazing way,” she said. “It’s the first time where I’m not constantly thinking about food.”

But to cover the out-of-pocket costs — nearly $2,000 so far — Ms. Simonton and her husband have reduced their spending on groceries and cut their retirement savings.

Ms. Simonton’s lawsuit, filed in state court in Washington last month, is seeking to force her health plan to pay for Wegovy going forward, as well as reimbursement from when she was denied coverage. Her lawyers are seeking class-action status on behalf of others like her who are insured through plans for public and school workers in Washington State.

In 2019, Washington State’s Supreme Court ruled that obesity is “always” a protected disability under the state’s anti-discrimination law. Other courts outside the state have ruled that obesity is not usually protected."
"Skeletons of 1918 Flu Victims Reveal Clues About Who Was Likely to Die
While a narrative emerged that the pandemic indiscriminately struck the young and healthy, new evidence suggests that frail young adults were most vulnerable.

The flu typically kills the very young, the old and the sick. That made the virus in 1918 unusual, or so the story goes: It killed healthy young people as readily as those who were frail or had chronic conditions.

Doctors of the time reported that, among those in the prime of their lives, good health and youth were no protection: The virus was indiscriminate, killing at least 50 million people, or between 1.3 and 3 percent of the world’s population. Covid, in contrast, killed 0.09 percent of the population.

But a paper published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences challenges that persistent narrative. Using evidence in skeletons of people who died in the 1918 outbreak, researchers reported that people who suffered from chronic diseases or nutritional deficiencies were more than twice as likely to die as those who did not have such conditions, no matter their age.

The 1918 virus did kill young people, but, the paper suggests, it was no exception to the observation that infectious diseases kill frail and sicker people most readily.

Sharon DeWitte, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and an author of the paper, said the finding had a clear message: “We should never expect any nonaccidental cause of death to be indiscriminate.”

The analysis of skeletons, said J. Alex Navarro, a historian of the flu pandemic at the University of Michigan, makes for “a fascinating paper and a very interesting approach to studying this issue.”

The lead author of the paper, Amanda Wissler, an anthropologist at McMaster University in Ontario, said she was intrigued by claims that the 1918 virus killed young and healthy people as readily as those with pre-existing conditions. In those days, there were no antibiotics or vaccines against childhood diseases, and tuberculosis was widespread among young adults.

There was a puzzle about who died from that flu, though, which helped fuel speculation that health was no protection. The flu’s mortality curve was unusual, shaped like a W. Ordinarily, mortality curves are shaped like a U, indicating that babies with immature immune systems and older people have the highest death rates.

The W arose in 1918 because death rates soared in people aged from about 20 to 40, as well as in babies and older people. That seemed to indicate that young adults were extremely vulnerable and, according to numerous contemporaneous reports, it did not matter if they were healthy or chronically ill. The flu was an equal opportunity killer.

In one report, Colonel Victor Vaughan, an eminent pathologist, described a scene at Fort Devens in Massachusetts. He wrote that he had seen “hundreds of young men in uniforms of their country, coming into the wards in groups of 10 or more.” By the next morning, he added, “the dead bodies are stacked about the ward like cord wood.”

The influenza pandemic, he wrote, “was taking its toll of the most robust, sparing neither soldier nor civilian, and flaunting its red flag in the face of science.”

Dr. Wissler and Dr. DeWitte, who have done similar research on the Black Death, saw a way to test the hypothesis about young people. When people have had lingering illnesses like tuberculosis or cancer, or other stressors like nutritional deficiencies, their shin bones develop tiny bumps.

Assessing frailty by looking for those bumps “is quite legitimate” as a method, said Peter Palese, a flu expert at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

The researchers used skeletons at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Its collection of 3,000 people’s remains, kept in large drawers in a massive room, includes each person’s name, age of death and date of death.

Dr. Wissler said she treated the remains “with great respect,” as she examined the shin bones of 81 people aged 18 to 80 who died in the pandemic. Twenty-six of them were between the ages of 20 and 40.

For comparison, the researchers examined the bones of 288 people who died before the pandemic.

The results were clear: Those whose bones indicated they were frail when they got infected — whether they were young adults or older people — were, by far, the most vulnerable. Many healthy people were killed, too, but those who were chronically ill to start with had a much greater chance of dying.

That makes sense, said Dr. Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist and professor emeritus at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health. But, he said, although the new study makes “an interesting observation,” the skeletons were not a random sample of the population, so it can be difficult to be specific about the risk that came with frailty.

“We are not used to the fact that younger healthy adults are going to die,” which often occurred in the 1918 pandemic, Dr. Monto said.

Dr. Palese said there was a reasonable explanation for the W-shaped mortality curve of the 1918 flu. It means, he said, that people older than 30 or 40 had most likely been exposed to a similar virus that had given them some protection. Younger adults had not been exposed."
"Teen Depression Rose Sharply During the Pandemic, but Treatment Didn’t Follow

The News
Approximately 20 percent of adolescents had symptoms of major depressive disorder in 2021 — the first full calendar year of the pandemic — but less than half who needed treatment received it, according to a new study.

The research, published in JAMA Pediatrics, found that treatment was most lacking for minority adolescents, particularly those who are Latino and mixed-race.

Background: Depression was already on the rise
Major depressive disorder is a chronic condition that surfaces in episodes of depressed mood and loss of joy, with symptoms lasting at least two weeks. It is distinct from persistent depressive disorder, in which symptoms last two years or more.

Previous research showed that the prevalence of major depressive disorder among adolescents nearly doubled recently, rising to 15.8 percent in 2019 from 8.1 percent in 2009. The Covid-19 pandemic amplified this trend as it caused isolation, uncertainty, loneliness and fear of illness among family members.

The Findings: Treatment gaps persist, especially for minority teens
The new study on the prevalence of major depressive disorder in 2021 drew from a nationally representative sample of 10,700 adolescents, ages 12 to 17, whose experiences were recorded by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

The study found some sharp differences in the prevalence of the condition across racial and ethnic groups. About 14.5 percent of Black adolescents, 14.6 percent of Asian adolescents and 20 percent of white adolescents reported symptoms of major depressive disorder. Latino adolescents experienced major depressive disorder at a slightly higher rate, around 23 percent.

Though mixed-race and Latino adolescents had the highest rates of major depressive disorder, they had the lowest rates of treatment, the study found. Twenty-one percent of mixed-race adolescents and 29 percent of Latino adolescents with the condition received treatment for it, compared with nearly half of white adolescents. Treatment rates for Asian and Black adolescents fell in between.

The study overlaps with previous research that found that adolescents from racial and ethnic minorities had fewer treatment options than their white peers did, with the most glaring gaps for teens living in lower-income communities.

What’s Next: Addressing the inequities
The authors of the study called for policymakers to recognize the inequities in treatment that were “highlighted” by the pandemic. “As we move forward,” they concluded in the paper, “policy and clinical efforts should target adolescents as a whole and marginalized populations in particular, to ensure timely access to high-quality mental health treatment.”"
"Her Strange Blisters Wouldn’t Go Away. What Was It?
It started with a bout of dry, itchy skin. Soon everything hurt. A specialist found a way to find some relief.

The 49-year-old woman knew as soon as she got out of bed that something was very wrong. A quick survey of her body revealed the source: Sprinkled around her bellybutton were a half dozen blisters. They were small — the largest maybe the size of a pencil eraser — and painful. They looked like the kind of blister you might get on your heel after wearing a new pair of shoes. Except they were on her belly.

She dressed carefully, choosing a pair of slacks that were a little loose around the middle. She put a long T-shirt under her sweater and hoped for the best. It was hard to concentrate at her job: The fleshy bubbles shot painful reminders every time she shifted position. When she got home, she immediately changed into a loosefitting dress. One of the blisters had ruptured, leaving an angry-looking raw red mark. She tried not to worry about it. It was September 2021; this was her first week back in the office after months of working at home, and she had too much on her mind already.

But the next day, there were a couple of more blisters. And the day after that. By the end of the week, her back and belly were dotted with a dozen of these odd bubbles. Another dozen had burst, leaving sores that seeped a clear fluid. At night, the opened blisters soaked through the gauze she applied, then through her pajamas and into the sheets. Every movement she made ripped open the weeping wounds that had dried, marrying flesh to fabric.

After a week of this, she took a sick day and began searching online for a dermatologist; after many calls, she found a practice where she could be seen the next day. The physician assistant who saw her was immediately concerned. After 40 years in practice, she had mastered the routine stuff — and this wasn’t routine. The patient told the P.A. that her skin had been extremely dry and itchy for months, but these blisters were new. As the P.A. examined the woman, she saw a few intact blisters but much of the woman’s torso was dotted with open splotches. This could be acne, she said. She would give her a cream for that. But it could also be a skin infection, and for that she prescribed an antibiotic. The patient should follow up in a couple of weeks so she could make sure things were moving in the right direction.

They weren’t. At the woman’s next appointment, her skin hadn’t improved. The P.A. brought in one of the dermatologists. This was clearly some kind of blistering disease, the doctor said. Possibly a type of disseminated infection called eczema herpeticum, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus. The doctor prescribed a potent steroid cream along with an antiviral medication to be taken for a week. That should clear things up, she told the woman confidently.

Blisters Everywhere
But over the next week, the blisters and the seeping spots that followed kept appearing. A second antibiotic was prescribed. More steroid creams.

At this point, everything she did hurt. The blisters were everywhere: on her arms, her legs and all over her back and stomach. They were even in her mouth and on her scalp. Sitting down was impossible. All she could do was perch at the very edge of the chair. When she went back, the determined P.A. brought in another dermatologist. He examined the woman closely and said: “I think this may be something called bullous pemphigoid. If it is, we can treat you.”

The P.A. explained that bullous pemphigoid (B.P.) is a rare autoimmune disease in which the body’s white blood cells create antibodies that attack the connection between the skin and the tissue below, causing these blisters. B.P. is treated with high-dose steroids, and when the disease cools off and blisters stop appearing, the steroids can be tapered down and sometimes stopped completely. The disease often resolves in a few months but can last for years.

She started taking 60 milligrams of prednisone every day. The drug was awful. She couldn’t sleep. She felt constantly hungry but at the same time bloated and full. She was weak. Her legs felt like each weighed 100 pounds. But the results were amazing. There were fewer new blisters. And the raw spots marking where old blisters had once been started healing. She took the prednisone for two months. Her skin got better, but she gained more than 20 pounds, and the weakness was so profound she could hardly get out of bed in the morning. The weight gain was depressing, but the weakness was intolerable.

Seeing how disabled she was, and how much her skin had improved, the P.A. lowered her dose. Almost immediately new crops of blisters arose. The P.A. increased the dose, but this woman clearly needed a different approach. She needed a doctor who specialized in these kinds of autoimmune diseases. There are internet groups for patients with B.P., the P.A. told the patient. They will know the best doctors for you. She was right. Through the International Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Foundation, she found a group of fellow sufferers online who lived not far from her on Long Island. They were unanimous in their recommendation: Dr. Allireza Alloo, an associate professor and attending physician at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell.

Hitting the Reset Button
When Alloo entered the exam room to meet his new patient, he could see how tired she was. And frustrated. She had been uncomfortable in her own skin for months, and the treatment was almost as bad as the disease. It started with the itch, she reported. She always suffered from dry skin in the icy depths of winter, but a couple of years earlier her skin got that same dry itchiness while she was vacationing with friends in balmy Hawaii. She bought her usual wintertime creams — moisturizers and low-dose steroid creams — and slathered herself at regular intervals. It helped, but the itch never went away completely.

Then she started getting canker sores — huge and painful ones. It hurt to eat. When one erupted in her mouth, she had to limit her diet to soups and shakes. And then the blisters started.

Alloo had her change into a gown and then did a full exam of her skin. Her blisters ranged from the size of a BB pellet to the size of a quarter. He could push down on them and they wouldn’t rupture or spread outward, as you might see with bullous pemphigoid. The skin over these blisters was thin, almost translucent. And they were delicate. Alloo could understand why the first dermatologists had thought she had B.P. That disease often starts with an intense itchiness before the blisters appear. But the disrupted tissue is deep, so the skin forming the blisters is thicker. And the blisters themselves are tense and not soft like these. This wasn’t B.P.

“You have pemphigus vulgaris,” Alloo told her, “and you are going to get better.” Pemphigus gets its name from the Greek word for blister. It was first described in the 18th century, and until the 20th century, with all its advances, every disease that caused blisters (and there are many) was called pemphigus. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder, like B.P., but even rarer. In this disease, antibodies attack the connection between cells in the topmost layers of the skin so that it is easily separated from the layers below. An old test for the disease, called the Nikolsky test, was to rub the normal-appearing skin next to the blisters. In pemphigus, that skin often sheers off in thin sheets. Mouth sores are usually the disorder’s first symptom. Until recently the diagnosis was made solely by biopsy. Now a blood test can help identify the specific antibodies that do the damage.

As with B.P., Alloo explained to the patient, pemphigus can often be treated with steroids. But when these are not sufficient or cause intolerable side effects, the next step is often a medication called rituximab. This powerful immune-suppressing drug destroys the antibody-producing white blood cells. When the next generation of these cells are created, they no longer make the abnormal antibodies. It’s like hitting the reset button at a cellular level.

The patient had her first two doses of rituximab soon after that. Over the next few months her skin began to clear. It has been a year and a half since she started treatment, and she still hasn’t fully recovered; she expects she’ll need a couple of more doses of rituximab. But she is confident Alloo was right. She is going to get well again."
"Feeling Terrible After Your Covid Shot? Then It’s Probably Working.
Fever, chills and fatigue may all be signs of vigorous antibody production, a new study finds.

A new study has an encouraging message for Americans who shy away from Covid shots because of worries about side effects: The chills, fatigue, headache and malaise that can follow vaccination may be signs of a vigorous immune response.

People who had those side effects after the second dose of a Covid vaccine had more antibodies against the coronavirus at one month and six months after the shot, compared with those who did not have symptoms, according to the new study. Increases in skin temperature and heart rate also signaled higher antibody levels.

“We know that vaccine uptake can be challenging, and in some cases, it can be so because some people have strong reactions to the vaccine,” said Aric Prather, a clinical psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the study.

“My hope is that this actually helps assuage some of those concerns,” said Dr. Prather, who studies how behavioral factors affect the immune system. “In fact, those symptoms, though they may be unpleasant, may actually be working for you.”

The study was posted online last week. It has not been reviewed for publication in a scientific journal. But several experts said it was well done, and its results were consistent with those from other research.

The relative increase in antibody levels among those who experienced side effects was small and doesn’t mean that people without symptoms don’t muster a strong immune response, experts said.

More on Covid-19
N95 Companies: Project N95 and Mask-C, two face mask providers, said they were closing, a sign of the slow and steady decline of what was once a much-sought-after item.
Omicron: In the two years since its emergence, the dominant variant of the coronavirus has proved to be not only staggeringly infectious, but an evolutionary marvel, challenging many assumptions virologists had before the pandemic.
Long Covid: As more young Americans report serious cognitive problems, scientists suggest that the increase captures the effects of long Covid, most likely in addition to other effects of the pandemic, including psychological distress.
Stroke Risk: The Covid vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may be linked to a slight increase in the risk of stroke when administered along with a high-dose flu vaccine that is usually given to older people, according to a new analysis by the F.D.A.
“Lack of side effects should not be taken as a sign that the vaccine’s not working,” said Alessandro Sette, co-director of the La Jolla Institute of Immunology’s Center for Vaccine Innovation, who was not involved in the work.

An earlier study found that 98 percent of people who felt no ill effects still produced copious amounts of antibodies, compared with 99 percent of those who had localized symptoms or worse, Dr. Sette said.

Still, the new results suggest that people who have a rough time after vaccination are likely to be well protected from the virus. “If you’re feeling crappy, then odds are that you’re probably mounting a pretty reasonable immune response,” said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the new study.

In research published last year, Dr. Bhattacharya and his colleagues looked at vaccine responses in 2,354 people, about half of whom took a painkiller to relieve side effects from the shot.

In mice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, severely impair immune responses to the coronavirus. But Dr. Bhattacharya’s team found that in people, the medications did not mute the immune response to Covid vaccines.

Not only that, but those who took a painkiller seemed to have more antibodies than those who tolerated the symptoms without medication. The most likely explanation for that is not that the painkillers increase antibody levels, Dr. Bhattacharya said.

“It’s more that people who have symptoms tend to have a slightly greater antibody response than those who don’t, and of course the people who have symptoms are more likely to take painkillers,” he said.

Other studies have also found that people with self-reported side effects, including fever, chills, body aches and fatigue, had slightly more antibodies than those without the symptoms.

In the new study, Dr. Prather and his colleagues tracked people’s antibody levels over time. When the vaccines were introduced in December 2020, they scrambled to recruit study participants through ads placed in newspapers and on television and social media.

At the time, much of U.C.S.F. was still closed down, so they commandeered a Pilates studio in the university gym, moving equipment out of the way and bringing in phlebotomists to draw the participants’ blood. The scientists excluded anyone who had evidence of a coronavirus infection before or during the study.

“We knew we had this very finite period where people were rushing to get vaccinated,” Dr. Prather said. “It was just an intense time, but we had to do what we had to do.”

The team tracked symptoms among 363 participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Covid vaccines for six days after each dose, and gave some participants biometric devices to record their temperature, breathing and heart rate.

Those who had seven distinct side effects — including chills, tiredness, feeling unwell and headache — produced nearly double the levels of antibodies as those who reported no symptoms, the researchers found. And a change in skin temperature of just one degree Celsius predicted antibody levels three times higher six months after the second dose.

The study measured protection against the Wuhan variant, the original version of the coronavirus. The research would be difficult to perform now because people have already had multiple infections or shots that would influence their immune responses, Dr. Prather said.

The current Covid shots are designed to protect from the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant, but the results should still be relevant to all iterations of the vaccines, experts said.

The rollout of Covid vaccines this fall has been bumpy, with canceled appointments and confusion about insurance coverage. But about four million Americans received the shots last month, according to the Department of Health and Human Services."
"Kaiser Permanente Workers Near End of Strike Without a Deal
Friday was the third day of a walkout for thousands of health care employees. No new contract talks were scheduled until next week.

Kaiser Permanente health care workers were finishing a three-day strike on Friday, and were expected to return to work early Saturday morning without a new contract.

No new negotiation sessions were scheduled until Thursday, Oct. 12, and Friday, Oct. 13. Union officials warned another walkout was possible. The two sides had not yet come to an agreement on several key issues, including wage increases.

“Outsourcing of critical health care duties has become a key sticking point in negotiations in recent days, as Kaiser executives have refused to put limitations on subcontracting and outsourcing, which keep experienced health care workers in jobs and provide strong continuity of care for patients,” the union officials said in a statement.

The effects of the three-day strike, which included X-ray technicians, receptionists, medical assistants and sanitation workers, were immediately apparent. Kaiser brought in thousands of outside workers to keep its hospitals, emergency departments and urgent care centers open, but a spokeswoman said the organization had been forced to reschedule some appointments and procedures, including surgeries not considered urgent.

On Friday, more than half of Kaiser’s 106 laboratories in Southern California were closed, according to the company’s website. In Oregon and Washington, almost two dozen Kaiser medical offices were also closed, and another 11 facilities that were still operating had temporarily shuttered various departments. Kaiser encouraged patients to use mail-order pharmacy services instead of picking up prescriptions in person and suggested that patients conduct virtual visits rather than appear at offices.

Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Tesla: Weeks after mechanics working for Tesla in Sweden walked off their jobs in late October, members of other unions across the country and elsewhere in Scandinavia have joined the strike in sympathy.
Amazon: More than a year and a half after workers on Staten Island voted to form the company’s first union in the United States, Amazon appears to be taking a harder line toward labor organizing.
Hollywood Actors: SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union, voted to approve a new three-year contract with studios, although some members remained dissatisfied with the deal’s A.I. protections. The ratification formally ended six months of labor unrest in the entertainment industry.
Doctors and Pharmacists: Medical professionals who once escaped the usual labor hierarchy are now unionizing, as the consolidation of health care companies has left them feeling powerless in big bureaucracies.
The acting head of the U.S. Department of Labor, Julie A. Su, met with officials from both sides of the negotiations this week and plans to be present when talks resume on Thursday, the agency said.

The stalemate occurred during a time of labor unrest nationwide. The tight labor market has emboldened many unions, causing a ripple of labor action across various industries. A Hollywood actor strike, autoworker picket lines and a threatened (but averted) United Parcel Service walkout, all within the last three months, indicate a cultural shift with no signs of slowing down.

Across the country, health workers have voiced frustration with working conditions and pay, pointing to burnout and excruciating staffing shortages that were exacerbated by the pandemic. More than a dozen health worker strikes have taken place this year in New York City, California, Illinois, Michigan and elsewhere.

The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, a collection of about a dozen unions, represents about half of Kaiser’s unionized work force and more than 75,000 workers who walked off the job. Its largest member union is S.E.I.U.-United Healthcare Workers, which has been active in labor disputes in California with other hospital systems like HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare. The union recently authorized a possible strike at 11 Tenet hospitals.

For Kaiser Permanente, whose health plans cover 13 million people in eight states, the labor action represented a turning point in what has historically been a relatively amicable relationship with employees.

Edith Hurtado, a medical assistant at a Kaiser clinic in San Francisco, said that she went on strike because her job was “getting exhausting,” and that patients were waiting longer for care because her clinic was so short-staffed.

The unions say they are fighting for more than higher wages and want Kaiser Permanente to address dangerously low levels of staffing at its hospitals and clinics. Unions across the country have pushed for improved conditions, including higher staffing levels and better protective equipment against the pandemic.

Research shows that health care unions’ fight to improve working conditions for their members often increases quality of care, said Adam Dean, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University who has studied the impact of unions on nursing homes. “There is very clear spillover effects for patients,” he said.

The strike is also about the rising cost of living. The group of unions represents clerical and maintenance workers, many of whom have been particularly hard hit and are struggling financially. Many are enraged by the million-dollar salaries of Kaiser executives.

“The lower-wage workers are finding they are falling behind,” said John August, who was the executive director for the coalition of Kaiser unions until 2013 and is now a program director at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations.

Timothy Regan, a clinical health educator for 25 years, was among the sea of protesters, clad in purple and yellow, who had flooded the sidewalks and medians in San Francisco on Wednesday, cheering and rattling tambourines.

“We want that collaborative good-faith partnership, and we wanted it months ago,” Mr. Regan said, adding that he wanted to ensure good working conditions for the next generation. “Many of us are surprised actually that it got to this point.”"
"Am I Still Contagious?
Here’s how to navigate eight of the most insidious and infectious illnesses.

Argh, you’re feeling sick again. You don’t want to take off work or go to the doctor if you don’t have to, but you also don’t want to be that person who infects the whole office (substitute “kid” and “classroom,” if applicable). You might have toughed it out before the pandemic, but the etiquette is different now. So how can you be sure about what you have, or if — and for how long — you need to stay home?

Here’s what infectious disease experts want you to know about some of the most common adult and pediatric viruses (and one bacterial infection): their symptoms, how they spread, how to treat them and when you (or your child) can re-enter society.

“Cold” is a catchall term for a mild respiratory infection. It’s most commonly caused by a rhinovirus, but adenoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses and metapneumovirus can also induce cold-like symptoms.

“We recognize it as being sort of the fallback diagnosis,” said Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor in the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

In some people, a Covid, flu or R.S.V. infection might result in mild symptoms and be mistaken for a cold.

Symptoms
Cold symptoms are familiar to most people: sore throat, runny nose, congestion and cough, sometimes combined with headache or fatigue.

Fever, muscle aches and lower respiratory symptoms — such as shortness of breath, wheezing or chest pain — are signs that you might have a more serious infection, like the flu or R.S.V.

“Neck and above is usually common cold, and down below is often something else,” Dr. Ray said.

Symptoms typically last about five to seven days, peaking in severity around Days 2 and 3 and tapering off after that.

How it’s spread
Rhinoviruses are spread primarily through droplets, meaning you breathe in what someone else coughs, sneezes or breathes out. They can also survive on surfaces for up to 24 hours, and you can become infected by touching your face after picking up virus particles from something like a door handle or TV remote control.

It typically takes a day or two after you’ve been exposed to a rhinovirus until you develop symptoms.

How it’s treated
There are no antiviral treatments for the common cold, but some over-the-counter medications and home remedies may help relieve symptoms. (Be sure to check medication labels: One common decongestant ingredient, phenylephrine, was recently deemed ineffective by an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration.)

How long you’re contagious
You are most infectious when you feel the worst, typically during the second and third days of symptoms. As you begin to feel better, the amount of virus in your body drops quickly, and it’s generally safe to assume that you’re no longer very contagious after Day 3 or 4, said Dr. Patricia Whitley-Williams, a professor of pediatrics at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.

Don’t worry if you still have a cough at that point; Dr. Ray said that this is because the airways can remain inflamed from the body’s immune response, not because the virus is still present. However, you should continue to practice good hygiene, like coughing into your elbow and frequently washing your hands. If you have a lot of mucus or other symptoms, you should behave as if you’re still contagious.

There’s debate over whether you need to stay home when you have a cold. Though colds typically aren’t risky, they are unpleasant and inconvenient, which can be reason enough to avoid spreading them to others. More important, if your cold is actually Covid or R.S.V., it could be dangerous for someone else.

Conjunctivitis, or pink eye, is a general term that means inflammation of the conjunctiva — the mucus membrane that lines the skin around your eyeball. It is most often caused by viruses in the adenovirus family. There are bacterial forms of conjunctivitis, too, but those are less common.

Symptoms
The symptoms of conjunctivitis are itchy, red and weepy eyes; they typically last between two and seven days (bacterial conjunctivitis resolves faster than viral). Adenovirus can spread from one eye to the other, so it’s possible to have pink eye for two weeks.

“Bacterial conjunctivitis, more classically, is just one eye,” said Dr. Lori Handy, an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “Viral conjunctivitis, more classically, is both eyes because it’s so contagious that it’s hard to protect one eye from the other.”

How it’s spread
Conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus spreads extremely easily. It’s transmitted by viral particles that get onto your finger, typically picked up from surfaces, and then spread to your eyes when you rub them.

How to treat it
If you think you or your child have pink eye, see a doctor to find out which type it is.

“This is one infection where I do really advocate for talking with your health care provider,” Dr. Handy said, “because the counseling is very different based on what type you have, as is the treatment.”

There is no treatment to get rid of viral conjunctivitis, and it will eventually resolve on its own. In the meantime, you can use damp compresses to help with symptoms. Bacterial conjunctivitis is treatable with antibiotic ointment or drops.

How long you’re contagious
As long as you have symptoms of viral conjunctivitis, you’re contagious; that can be anywhere from a few days to a couple weeks, depending on if you get it in both eyes.

The best way to prevent spreading it to others is to stay home from work or school until your symptoms are gone. If the infection lingers for weeks, talk to your doctor about whether there are ways to safely go out in public. At the very least, do not touch your eyes, and be diligent about hand washing — that means frequent lathering with soap and water (adenoviruses are so hearty that hand sanitizer won’t cut it).

Adenoviruses can also live on surfaces for several weeks, so disinfecting contaminated objects (like eyeglasses) and high-touch surfaces (like light switches) is essential.

“It’s very, very contagious,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “You rely on isolation until you get better — and hand washing.”

Bacterial conjunctivitis is less common, less contagious and more treatable. People are usually no longer infectious a day or two after starting antibiotics.

By now, most of us are all too familiar with Covid, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. While the virus has evolved since the early days of the pandemic, how it spreads and the symptoms it causes have largely remained the same.

Symptoms
The most common Covid symptoms are sore throat, congestion, fatigue, fever and cough, which can make it hard to distinguish from other respiratory viruses.

Rapid tests are still the easiest way to determine if what you have is Covid. If you test negative on the first try, swab yourself again 48 hours later because you may not have had enough virus in your nose initially for a rapid test to detect the infection. PCR tests are more precise, but they are more expensive and less convenient because you have to go to a doctor’s office or pharmacy to receive one.

Symptoms resolve within a week for most people, but some can have protracted infections that linger for weeks or even develop into long Covid.

How it’s spread
More than any other respiratory virus on this list, Covid is spread by tiny airborne particles.

“Every time you take a breath, your virus is going out into the room, and it sort of hangs there,” said Dr. Edward E. Walsh, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the head of infectious diseases at Rochester General Hospital. “People can walk by and inhale it and get infected.”

It is also transmitted in larger respiratory droplets that are expelled when you cough or sneeze. However, the virus does not appear to spread very well via surfaces, so becoming infected by touching a contaminated object and then touching your face is less of a concern.

Once infected, it takes about two to four days for symptoms to develop.

How it’s treated
Taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid within the first five days of an infection can reduce the risk of severe disease. The vaccines are also very effective at preventing hospitalization and death. For relief from mild symptoms, over-the-counter medications for cold and flu may help.

How long you’re contagious
Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people can go out in public after their fifth day of symptoms, as long as they are fever-free. However, people should continue masking for another five days to minimize the risk of spreading the virus to others.

Experts say this is generally good advice. For most people, “Covid is no longer infectious in the second week,” said Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor in the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “But the variability is still there.”

For example, if you have a moderate or severe case of Covid, in which you are experiencing shortness of breath or have to go to the hospital, you should isolate for 10 days. “The more severe the infection, the more protracted the infectiousness,” Dr. Ray said.

Some people continue to test positive on rapid tests after Day 5, but research suggests that most are no longer contagious at that point because the virus has stopped replicating. To be safe, follow the guidance from the C.D.C. and continue to mask in public for Days 6 through 10.

Words of warning
The risk of hospitalization and death from an acute case of Covid has diminished significantly since the beginning of the pandemic because nearly everyone has antibodies to the virus now, thanks to vaccines, a prior infection or both. But for older adults, people with pre-existing conditions like heart disease and diabetes and people who are immunocompromised, some risk remains. There is also the concern of longer-term health consequences, including long Covid and cardiovascular complications, after the immediate infection resolves.

The seasonal flu is caused by two types of influenza viruses: A and B. Both can be circulating simultaneously, but typically one subtype dominates each flu season.

It’s often not easy to tell whether you have the flu versus another respiratory virus, but you can get tested at a pharmacy or doctor’s office. At-home rapid flu tests are available in other countries but not in the United States, though experts hope they will be eventually.

Symptoms
Flu symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, congestion and cough, as well as fatigue, fever, headache and muscle aches. Some people also experience vomiting or diarrhea.

The clearest indicator that you have the flu might be how bad you feel and how quickly that misery comes on — a common analogy is that it feels as if you’ve been hit by a truck.

“If you feel much sicker than you have with other colds, then be thinking about flu,” said Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor in the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

People typically feel the worst during their first three days of illness and then symptoms start to taper off, resolving after about a week.

How it’s spread
Influenza is primarily spread through respiratory droplets — the mucus and saliva that are dispersed by coughing, sneezing or talking. The virus is also present in smaller aerosol particles that stay suspended in the air, though experts say you’re less likely to get infected from aerosols alone. Influenza can be transmitted by droplets that land on objects and surfaces, too, where the virus remains infectious for many hours.

While all modes of infection are possible, “it’s probably driven by close-range transmission,” said Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University School of Medicine. If you’re near an infected person, she said, “you’re inhaling small aerosols, large aerosols and potentially touching things that are contaminated in that space.” Putting a mask on the sick person reduces the risk that they will infect others.

Once you’re infected, it usually takes two to four days until symptoms emerge.

How it’s treated
Your best weapon against the flu is getting an annual flu shot, which significantly reduces the risk of a severe infection.

There are also antiviral treatments, such as Tamiflu, that can help minimize symptoms. These medications need to be taken in the first few days of the illness, so it’s essential to get tested and treated early. Home remedies and over-the-counter medications can also help with symptom relief, but take a close look at the labels — an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration recently said that phenylephrine, a common decongestant ingredient, is ineffective.

How long you’re contagious
Experts say five days is a reasonable estimate for how long someone is contagious with the flu. Most people begin shedding virus the day before they start feeling sick, and they’re most contagious during the first three days of symptoms. Virus levels drop as symptoms begin to abate.

“If I got flu Monday, by Friday I’m probably not very infectious for others,” said Dr. Edward E. Walsh, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the head of infectious diseases at Rochester General Hospital.

After that, Dr. Lakdawala said, “if you’re starting to feel better, you’ll probably not have as much virus in your nose,” and it’s fine to go out in the community. However, she added, if you have lingering symptoms, or if you’re going to see someone who is at high risk for severe infection (for instance, if the person is over 65 or has a pre-existing condition), you should wait another few days or wear a mask.

You may still be coughing at that point because of lingering inflammation in the airways. That late-stage cough is unlikely to be contagious, but you should continue to wash your hands frequently and cover your mouth when you cough, just in case.

Words of warning
One of the primary concerns with influenza, and one of the main causes of influenza-related death, is pneumonia. Signs that you may have pneumonia and should seek medical attention are shortness of breath, pain when you breathe, coughing up very dark mucus and coughing attacks so severe that they cause you to vomit.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by viruses in the enterovirus family, such as coxsackievirus. It is most common in children under the age of 5, but adults can contract it, too.

Symptoms
As the name suggests, the disease characteristically involves a rash on the hands and feet and sores in the mouth; children often develop a fever, too. Symptoms are usually worst in the first two to three days and last for about a week.

The rash looks like small red bumps, sometimes containing fluid — like little pimples. You don’t want to pop these, since the virus is in the fluid and can potentially infect others.

The mouth sores — often the most painful part of the illness — are typically on the gums or the tongue and may stop children from eating or drinking. “That may be the first tip that they have sores in their mouth,” said Dr. Patricia Whitley-Williams, a professor of pediatrics at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. If you take a look, sometimes you can actually see these ulcers, or little blisters or sores, she said.

How it’s spread
Enteroviruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease are highly contagious and are spread primarily through saliva and stool. Hand washing is the best way to prevent the virus from spreading, but if one child falls ill, an outbreak in a day care center or school is hard to avoid.

“You see them most often in young children and toddlers because they share, unfortunately, saliva and stool in child care settings,” said Dr. Lori Handy, an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

It takes between three and six days after exposure to the virus for someone to develop symptoms.

How to treat it
There’s no treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease, just symptom relief. That means taking fever reducers and pain killers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Be sure your child is still eating and drinking so they don’t become dehydrated. Dr. Handy recommends cold, soft foods like ice pops and yogurt. Stay away from anything acidic or fizzy, which can irritate the mouth sores.

How long you’re contagious
People are most contagious when they first experience symptoms. Once the fever is gone for 24 hours, the mouth sores are mostly resolved and the rash is starting to heal, children can go back to school — that can take anywhere from a few days to a week.

“I wouldn’t be cavalier about it and send your child to school sick,” Dr. Handy said, adding: “If they’re past those acute symptoms, they’re then at the point where they have a lower likelihood of spreading.”

However, people can continue to shed enterovirus in their stool for several weeks after they’re no longer symptomatic, so some risk of transmission remains. Because of this, it’s important to practice good hand hygiene and disinfect contaminated objects.

Words of warning
In very rare cases, enteroviruses can cause encephalitis or meningitis — inflammation of the brain or tissues and fluid that surround it. This risk appears to be greatest in infants. Signs to watch out for are high fever and severe headache; in babies, this may show up as extreme irritability, or it may be difficult to rouse them. If this happens, take your child to a hospital right away.

“I don’t want to alarm any of the readers or the public, but just like any virus,” sometimes there are certain rare strains that can cause complications, Dr. Whitley-Williams said.

Norovirus is the most common cause of short-lived gastrointestinal illnesses. If you’ve ever had a stomach bug, chances are it was norovirus, said Dr. Ferric Fang, a professor of laboratory medicine and microbiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

Symptoms
Norovirus symptoms come on suddenly and typically last one to two (miserable) days. They include diarrhea and vomiting, as well as nausea and stomach pain.

How it’s spread
Norovirus is incredibly contagious — just a few viral particles can infect someone. Once a person comes into contact with the virus, it usually takes a day or two until symptoms hit.

The virus is most commonly spread through particles left on surfaces and objects by an infected person who didn’t wash their hands properly after using the bathroom (the so-called fecal-oral route).

Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said he remembered a bridge club in which all of the members caught norovirus because their playing cards were contaminated. “You pick up the cards, you get the virus on your finger,” he said, “and then if you touch your nose or your mouth, bingo.”

Norovirus particles can spread through food, too. It’s thought to be one of the primary causes of food poisoning — you get sick not from a food source, but from a sick food handler who contaminates the food.

It can also be transmitted via aerosols from vomit or diarrhea, so it’s possible to catch it if you’re in the same room as a person who is throwing up.

Because norovirus spreads so easily, hand hygiene and surface cleaning are essential when someone around you is sick. And hand sanitizer and gentle cleaners won’t cut it — you need to use soap and water for your hands and a bleach-based cleaner for contaminated surfaces.

“It’s extremely infectious, so if someone in your household has it,” the virus is very difficult to avoid, Dr. Fang said. He recommends having the person who is ill use a dedicated bathroom, if possible.

How to treat it
There’s no real treatment for norovirus. In fact, doctors typically advise against coming in to see them when you have a 24- to 48-hour stomach bug because there’s not much they can do for you, and you might spread the virus to other patients, Dr. Fang said.

You just need to ride it out and try to prevent dehydration — drinks that contain electrolytes, like Gatorade or Pedialyte, are often recommended.

How long you’re contagious
People can remain contagious with norovirus for weeks after their symptoms resolve because they continue to shed viral particles in their stool, though the levels are not as high as when they first fell ill.

Of course, it’s not realistic to stay home from work or school for that long, so once you’re no longer vomiting or experiencing diarrhea, it’s OK to return to the real world. However, you should continue to be extra vigilant about washing your hands after you use the bathroom.

Respiratory syncytial virus was once dismissed as just another mild cold virus, but it can be serious for infants and older adults. The severe consequences of R.S.V. were on display last winter when it contributed to the “tripledemic,” alongside Covid and the flu.

“Infectious disease experts have appreciated how bad R.S.V. is for a long time,” said Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor in the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine. But, he added, before last year, it had largely “flown below the radar” for the rest of us.

Symptoms
With mild cases, it can be hard to tell if you have R.S.V., as opposed to a cold, the flu or Covid; a runny or stuffy nose, cough, headache and fever can occur with all four diseases. However, experts say that R.S.V. has a greater likelihood of affecting the lungs and lower respiratory tract, causing severe coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.

“It tends to cause a lot of reactivity of your airways, so you cough and you wheeze a lot,” said Dr. Helen Chu, a professor in the division of allergy and infectious diseases at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

Most symptoms typically last about a week, though a cough can linger long after other symptoms clear up.

How it’s spread
R.S.V. is most commonly spread through droplets expelled in an infected person’s sneeze or cough that then get into someone else’s nose or mouth. It’s possible for R.S.V. to remain suspended in the air as tiny aerosol particles, but it is much less contagious in that form, said Dr. Edward E. Walsh, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the head of infectious diseases at Rochester General Hospital.

Regardless of the mode of transmission, infection is most likely to occur when you’re within a few feet of the person, Dr. Walsh said. Backing this up, one small study conducted in the early 1980s that deliberately exposed people to infants with R.S.V. found that the volunteers who picked up and held the sick babies were much more likely to get infected than the ones who were in the room but did not interact with them.

The virus can survive on surfaces for several hours, so there is also a risk of infecting yourself by touching contaminated objects and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. In the study mentioned above, a smaller proportion of people got infected this way.

It typically takes about five days after contact with the virus until symptoms develop.

How it’s treated
There are no antiviral treatments for R.S.V., but the over-the-counter medications and home remedies you use to relieve general respiratory symptoms may help.

As of this year, there are two vaccines for adults age 60 and older that protect against severe R.S.V. One of the vaccines is also approved for pregnant women in their third trimester so that they can pass on antibodies through the placenta to their newborns. Another new preventive therapy uses monoclonal antibodies to protect infants from severe R.S.V.

How long you’re contagious
As with other respiratory viruses, you’re most infectious during the first few days when you’re most symptomatic; virus levels drop around Day 5. After that, experts say it’s safe to assume that you’re no longer very contagious and you can go back to work or school — as long as you don’t have a fever and aren’t producing a lot of mucus. If you will be around older adults or young children, it’s best not to get too close to them for a few more days, just in case.

Keep in mind that you may still be coughing beyond Day 5 because your airways can remain inflamed after the virus is gone. “Those are post-infectious coughs,” Dr. Walsh said. “They are no longer shedding infectious virus.” If you want to be extra careful, you can always wear a mask.

Words of warning
R.S.V. can be deadly for the very young and very old. It’s the leading cause of hospitalization for infants in the United States and results in 6,000 to 10,000 deaths per year for adults age 65 and up. Seek medical attention if you or your child are having trouble breathing.

Strep throat is the odd one out in this list of diseases because it’s caused by a bacteria: Group A streptococcus. Close to 100 strains of Group A streptococcus exist, and they can result in several diseases, including scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and skin infections, but strep throat is the most common.

Symptoms
The characteristic symptom of strep throat is, of course, a very sore throat. You might also see a white film in the back of the infected person’s throat; some people develop a fever, too.

Many infections can cause a sore throat — what distinguishes strep throat is that it isn’t accompanied by other common respiratory symptoms, like a runny nose or cough. The only way to know for certain if you have it is to be tested by a doctor using a throat swab.

How it’s spread
Strep throat is transmitted through close personal contact with an infected person, primarily in the form of respiratory droplets. That means what’s coming out of their nose and mouth goes into yours.

Strep throat doesn’t appear to spread very well via objects. One study conducted in the 1950s among military recruits found that people who used blankets contaminated with streptococcus bacteria were no more likely to develop strep throat than those who received clean blankets.

“The inanimate environment plays a minor role in the transmission of Group A strep,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “It’s all close personal contact.”

It typically takes about 48 hours after an exposure until symptoms develop.

How it’s treated
If you think that you have strep throat, get tested immediately because the disease can be treated quickly and easily with antibiotics, like penicillin or amoxicillin.

“Pretty much every patient who is diagnosed with strep throat should be treated with a course of antibiotics,” said Dr. Stanford Shulman, an emeritus professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

How long you’re contagious
Once antibiotics are started, the bacteria die off quickly, and within roughly 24 hours the person is no longer contagious. As a result, the experts say that children can go back to school a day after they begin medication. They might still have a mild sore throat, but there is no risk to others.

“Most kids can return to school within that next 12 to 24 hours, as long as they’re otherwise doing well: fever-free, eating and drinking OK,” said Dr. Lori Handy, an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Words of warning
In addition to reducing the risk of transmission, it’s also critical to treat strep throat because the bacteria can cause other, more severe infections. Those include skin infections known as cellulitis and impetigo, as well as scarlet fever and rheumatic fever, where the immune system starts attacking the heart valve. In the most severe — and rare — cases, streptococcus bacteria can cause a blood infection, bone infection, septic shock or necrotizing fasciitis — a flesh-eating infection.

It’s important to know about these more severe manifestations “not to scare parents,” Dr. Handy said, but to make sure they get their children treated, and, “if symptoms worsen, they get medical attention quickly.”

"My Husband Is Facing Dementia. Can I Help Him End His Life?
The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on how to assist a spouse in the midst of a life-or-death dilemma.

I’m in my early 70s, and I’m married to a man in his 60s. My husband’s father struggled with Alzheimer’s for almost a dozen years before he died. It was incredibly hard on everyone involved. And now my husband is in the midst of his own health crisis. He has had some significant cognitive decline in the past two years, which affects his ability to function to his satisfaction. He is constantly looking for his phone or iPad. He gets lost while driving. He sometimes asks me to help him send a text or email because he can’t remember how to do it. This causes him so much shame. He says he no longer belongs in this world. His dysfunction reminds him of his father’s decline, and he doesn’t want to put himself or others through that pain.

The neurologist is less than helpful. My husband does fairly well on 10-minute cognitive screenings, so he receives a diagnosis of mild cognitive decline instead of dementia. He has started to talk about suicide and is afraid I will stop him. He has asked me to commit to letting him choose his time of death. Frankly, I respect his choice and believe he has the right to decide for himself. He has also asked for help in researching the best way to kill himself. I have considered trying to help him with that but fear that I am committing or abetting a crime.

What’s the ethical thing to do? (And yes, I understand that what’s ethical and what’s legal may differ.) — Name Withheld, North Carolina

From the Ethicist:

I’m so sorry about the situation you both find yourselves in, and wish it were rarer than it is. We are, I agree, entitled to decide that losing the cognitive functions necessary for a life of autonomy deprives us of the possibility of a dignified existence. And so we’re entitled, in my view, to make plans to end our lives when that happens. Unfortunately, once it does happen, we may not be able to recognize our situation or to execute our plans. Even states that (unlike yours) have “medical aid in dying” statutes don’t allow such aid to patients with an impaired capacity for decision-making — it can’t be secured by an advance directive.

How do these broad principles and circumstances apply to your case? I’m not going to pronounce on the legality of helping your husband end his life — either now, when he remains mentally competent, or at some later point when, as he fears, he will no longer be. (A lawyer can tell you how your legal exposure will be affected by the details of your assistance given the laws of your state.) I will say that, inasmuch as it isn’t morally wrong for your husband to end his own life, it isn’t wrong for you to provide the advice that he requests.

But to deny that an action is wrong isn’t to say that it’s necessarily wise, or anyway, that you should hastily pursue it. Right now, your husband — distraught, suffused with shame, anguished by the prospect of sharing his father’s fate — could be prone to acting precipitously. Older men are far more likely to kill themselves than older women, and one reason may relate to gender norms; men may feel especially humiliated when they come to depend more on others. The fact remains that countless people lead lives of value while experiencing some noticeable measure of cognitive decline. They’re able to give and receive love, even joy. And it’s impossible to predict when deficits will cross into outright dementia, if this is what’s in store; there can be extended periods of stability. Advance care planning, prepared while your husband is legally competent, can give him at least some control over his medical future. In the meantime, I’d urge him to consider that his current impairment doesn’t mean his existence offers nothing of value, to him and to those who care about him.

Readers Respond
Last week’s question was from a reader who was concerned about vacationing in a country that has a poor human rights record. She wrote: “My husband and I are now retired and are looking forward to making some long-postponed, once-in-a-lifetime trips. Unfortunately, the country at the very top of our bucket list has an authoritarian government and a poor human rights record. … Our tourism dollars would directly support the local tourism industry and the people who rely on it for their livelihoods. But we’re concerned that it would indirectly support the regime in power, as well. How do we evaluate the ethical implications?”

In his response, the Ethicist noted: “The case against visiting isn’t so much that you’re actually going to be prolonging a bad regime (any effect would be microscopic); rather, it’s that there’s something inherently regrettable about contributing to the welfare of wrongdoers. … suppose there were currently a boycott in place that had support from credible representatives of the people of that country and was having, or was likely to have, positive effects in improving conditions there. If that were the case, you should honor the boycott. It can be good to participate in a political process even when — as with voting — your personal contribution has a minuscule effect on the outcome.” (Reread the full question and answer here.)

I agree with the Ethicist. The government does not necessarily represent the entire population. I would not want a political outcome in the United States to make people reconsider visiting. — Theresa

⬥

Letting the boycott gods decide whether or not to go is abrogating personal moral responsibility. — Larry

⬥

A separate issue is whether it’s safe for Americans to travel to the country in question. Check the State Department’s list to make sure there is no travel advisory for this country, and if there is, do not disregard it. Making reckless choices that may require others to take on risks to rescue you from the consequences is itself unethical. — Anna

⬥

One additional factor that should be considered is the fact that long-distance travel by jet is highly destructive environmentally. Anyone who is seriously concerned about global warming should reconsider any such travel that is purely for pleasure. — Ray

⬥

My husband and I are retired and living in his birth nation, whose democratic government was replaced by a military dictatorship a decade ago. By all means visit your bucket list destination and, to the extent that you can, give all of your business to small hotels, markets, local stores and people on the streets. Avoid high-end hotels, restaurant chains, big time tour operators and other businesses that you expect might be owned by autocrats and their rich cronies. You’ll be rewarded by charming people who greatly appreciate your business and attention. — Douglas"
"Once a Ticket to Travel and to Socialize, Paper Covid-19 Cards Are Going Away
The C.D.C. has stopped distributing the 3-by-4-inch cards, a mainstay of American wallets in the earlier days of the pandemic.

The paper Covid vaccination cards were, for a time, a mainstay of American wallets — pulled out before bouncers, inspected at airport desks and shared with pride on social media accounts.

But the days of the paper cards are over. The Covid-19 cards will “no longer be given out,” Dave Daigle, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement Thursday, explaining that the distribution of the vaccine had transitioned from the federal government to commercial hands.

People receiving vaccinations will still receive a fact sheet with information about the vaccine, he added, and state health departments will still hold a digital or paper copy.

This makes the cards a relic of the bleaker days of the pandemic, when they were handed out as part of a mass vaccination campaign. They became a valuable document representing not only some physical protection against Covid 19 but also access to a myriad of social activities.

Given after the first vaccination, the card detailed the manufacturer of a vaccine, the dose numbers, the date and location each shot was administered, and any follow-up shots.

More on Covid-19
N95 Companies: Project N95 and Mask-C, two face mask providers, said they were closing, a sign of the slow and steady decline of what was once a much-sought-after item.
Omicron: In the two years since its emergence, the dominant variant of the coronavirus has proved to be not only staggeringly infectious, but an evolutionary marvel, challenging many assumptions virologists had before the pandemic.
Long Covid: As more young Americans report serious cognitive problems, scientists suggest that the increase captures the effects of long Covid, most likely in addition to other effects of the pandemic, including psychological distress.
Stroke Risk: The Covid vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may be linked to a slight increase in the risk of stroke when administered along with a high-dose flu vaccine that is usually given to older people, according to a new analysis by the F.D.A.
As vaccinations were administered across the United States beginning in December 2020, the cards became a coveted symbol for many recipients that they might avoid the worst symptoms of the virus. People took selfies with their card, sharing them online to support a public health campaign that some Americans were hesitant to embrace and that some outright rejected. (Some authorities warned people to stop sharing their card information online, saying that they were possibly giving valuable personal information to identity thieves.)

In summer 2021, as officials began lifting lockdown restrictions on public venues, the paper cards took on extra meaning, becoming a ticket in some areas to social gatherings and to some international travel. Much like keys and IDs, they were a constant companion, flashed in front of bars, restaurants and concert venues that required them for entry. But the benefits they offered also raised questions of whether it would cause divisions in society between those were vaccinated and those who were not.

In some communities, gyms mandated them to enroll in group classes, and sports stadiums added sections for the vaccinated. Airlines and cruise companies asked to see the cards before travelers could visit certain countries.

And they created a market for opportunists: Scammers forged or stole copies of the cards, selling them illegally for up to $60 a piece. Other enterprising minds, cognizant that the 3-by-4-inch cards were slightly too awkward to fit unfolded in a wallet, came up with protective cardholders, both functional and bedazzled.

The paper pass became increasingly outdated in the United States and abroad as digital health passes replaced them. And as travel restrictions were lifted in most places — the United States stopped requiring proof of vaccination for international travelers this May — even the digital health passes have largely been phased out.

More than 270 million people have received at least one dose of a vaccination, according to the C.D.C.’s tracker. With updated Covid vaccines now on the market and a risk of a surge in infections this fall and winter, the C.D.C. last month recommended that all Americans 6 months and older receive at least one dose of the latest shots.

Pharmacies have confirmed that people do not need to bring the old paper cards, long lost for many people, to receive a new vaccine. But the C.D.C. has also recommended keeping vaccination records when possible to give to health providers.

Those with a paper card may still want to hold onto it — for practical, if not sentimental, reasons."
"What Does It Really Mean to Dissociate?
People are turning to social media to define dissociative disorders, but those portrayals aren’t always accurate. Here is a primer.

Have you ever zoned out?

Maybe you have experienced highway hypnosis, with no recollection of having driven from Point A to Point B. Or maybe you have zero memory of something you just read.

These are mild forms of dissociation, which is the ability to disconnect from our thoughts, feelings, environment or actions.

Dissociation can even help athletes do their jobs, for instance, because it “allows people to focus on the most salient or life-preserving aspects of a situation” without mental interference, said Janina Fisher, a psychologist who has been treating dissociative disorders for decades.

But sometimes people experience a major form of dissociation, often in the aftermath of overwhelming trauma. In this case, the dissociative symptoms become more extreme and frequent.

Public fascination with dissociation and its disorders has endured for many years — examples include the books “Sybil” and “The Three Faces of Eve,” both adapted into wildly popular feature films, each about a woman with “multiple personalities.”

Now people are capturing their experiences with dissociation and posting them on social media. TikTok videos hashtagged #dissociativeidentitydisorder, or D.I.D., have been viewed more than 1.7 billion times and #dissociation has drawn more than 775 million views. Some show what it looks like to dissociate, or use visual effects to explain the eerie feeling of living outside your body. In others, people describe their different identities, also called alters or parts.

Celebrities like the “Saturday Night Live” cast member Bowen Yang have also openly described struggles with dissociative disorders, as conversations about mental health continue to migrate into public forums.

But research suggests that much of this content isn’t providing reliable information. We asked several mental health providers to explain more about dissociation.

What are the dissociative disorders?
Rather than fight or flee in a stressful or threatening situation, some people “freeze,” said Dr. Frank W. Putnam, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and an expert on dissociative disorders. “That’s the dissociative state where you shut down and you kind of go away.”

Although dissociation can help a person mentally escape during a threat, it can interfere with daily life when people continue to dissociate during benign situations. Some people might find themselves in a new location without knowing how they got there, for example.

Frequent experiences like that make dissociation pathological, Dr. Putnam said. It becomes a disorder when you space out and “lose time” long enough that it interferes with your life in a significant way, he added.

The three most common and well-known dissociative disorders are: dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization/derealization disorder and dissociative amnesia.

The common thread in each is a disruption of identity.

The most severe is dissociative identity disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder. Those who experience D.I.D. report having two or more identities. Studies indicate that around 1 to 1.5 percent of the population has D.I.D. But some say the prevalence could be higher.

“I think it’s way underdiagnosed,” said Dr. Judith Herman, a psychiatrist and pioneer in the field of trauma studies. That’s largely because “you still hear people in my field saying they don’t ‘believe in D.I.D.’”

Despite the inclusion of D.I.D. in the D.S.M.-5., the American Psychiatric Association’s official manual of mental disorders, some psychiatrists and psychologists think that patients with symptoms of D.I.D. actually have borderline personality disorder. Others think it is a fad or that it can be induced by a provider.

Experiencing severe childhood trauma at an early age, such as sexual abuse, is a predictor of developing D.I.D., several experts said.

Dr. Fisher acknowledged that “it’s a hard-to-believe diagnosis unless you’ve seen it.” Patients show changes in body language, facial expression and cognitive ability, she added. “It is sort of dramatic and sounds almost fantastical.”

Depersonalization/derealization disorder is thought to occur in about 1 to 2 percent of the population and is often associated with a history of verbal abuse, like shaming, that drives someone to want to disconnect from an emotionally traumatizing environment, Dr. Putnam said.

According to the A.P.A., those who experience depersonalization can feel at times as though they are detached from their mind or body — estranged from themselves — like they are watching events happen to them. Derealization, on the other hand, refers to feeling detached from the environment as though the people and things in the world are not real, in some cases appearing like cardboard cutouts.

The prevalence of dissociative amnesia is not well established. It occurs in response to a variety of different types of trauma, and involves having blocks of time where you lose your identity and are not able to recall important information about your life, such as your own name.

Both dissociative amnesia and depersonalization/derealization symptoms commonly accompany D.I.D.

Why are dissociative disorders attracting so much attention?
“I had thought that the internet and app-based world would bring us all closer together. And it’s had exactly the opposite effect,” said Dr. David Spiegel, a Stanford University psychiatry professor who has worked with patients with D.I.D. for about 50 years. “It has fragmented us.”

What he means, he explained, is that many of us have retreated into our own online echo chambers. Some people truly have D.I.D., or any number of mental health disorders, but others might be incorrectly labeling themselves because they are locked into a D.I.D. information loop — either by choice or via an aggressive social media algorithm.

The idea of having alternate realities or different identities is one that may especially resonate during adolescence, experts said, a time when many teenagers struggle with the question “Who am I?”

Dr. David Rettew, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and the medical director of Lane County Behavioral Health in Eugene, Ore., has worked with many adolescents who learned about dissociative disorders on social media and are now questioning whether they have them.

Dr. Rettew encouraged anyone curious about a specific disorder to speak with an attentive and thoughtful health care provider, particularly one who understands trauma, to tease out what might be going on.

“Just about everything in mental health is dimensional. It exists on a spectrum,” he said. “And that doesn’t make our conditions less real, but it does make them more complicated.”"
"The Wegovy Shortage Drags On, Leaving Patients in Limbo
The situation has left many patients frustrated and unable to start taking the weight loss drug.

When Mark Basa needed his next dose of Wegovy, he worked his way down a list of 10 CVS stores within a 25-mile radius of his Peekskill, N.Y., home — and struck out at every one. In the 10 weeks he couldn’t find the drug, he regained the eight pounds he had lost on the medication, and his blood sugar rose. He felt himself get out of breath more often. His shirts fit tighter.

“It was anxiety-inducing,” Mr. Basa, 37, said. “It was like, ‘Well, I’m never going to lose this weight.’”

Wegovy has appeared on the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage list since March 2022. But doctors and patients say that the situation has worsened in the months since Novo Nordisk, the Danish company that manufactures the drug, limited the availability of the three lowest doses of Wegovy. With demand climbing faster than supply can keep up, the move effectively slows the pace of people starting the drug, because patients must begin with a low dose that is gradually increased. The shortage has fueled widespread frustration among potential patients, as well as those like Mr. Basa who need to refill their prescriptions or risk regaining weight.

“It’s created this living hell,” said Dr. Andrew Kraftson, a clinical associate professor in the division of metabolism, endocrinology and diabetes at Michigan Medicine.

A Novo Nordisk representative wrote in an email that the drugmaker anticipates “ongoing supply disruption” for those three doses as demand continues to outpace production. The company did not have an estimate for how long they will continue to limit those doses.

A Close Look at Weight Loss Drugs
Teenage Obesity: Twenty-two percent of adolescents age 12 to 19 have obesity. But pediatricians are hesitant to prescribe medicines like Wegovy, citing their newness and uncertainties around them.
Menopausal Weight Gain: Some women going through menopause are seeking drugs like Ozempic to help with excess weight. Experts worry about the risks, but some doctors are beginning to oblige.
A Striking Benefit: A pivotal new study suggests that the weight loss drug Wegovy cut the risk of heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular issues by 20% among overweight or obese people with heart disease.
Reshaping Denmark’s Economy: Novo Nordisk, the Danish company behind Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug also used by some people for weight loss, is reaping huge profits and is now responsible for most of the country’s economic growth.
Side Effects: Diabetes treatments that are used to lose weight can reduce people’s desire to drink alcohol and their obsessive thinking about food. The drugs also carry serious risks, including malnutrition and facial aging.
“The pipe is closed,” said Dr. Scott Hagan, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Washington who studies obesity. Dr. Hagan sees patients with severe arthritis in need of hip and knee replacements who are above the body mass index threshold for surgery; Wegovy could help them lose enough weight to have surgery, he said, but not if they’re unable to start the drug.

What happens when people can’t find Wegovy?
Wegovy is an injectable version of a compound called semaglutide, which slows the emptying of the stomach and, in turn, makes people feel full faster and for longer. It also targets the areas of the brain that regulate appetite, reducing cravings and silencing what some people call “food noise.”

New patients start by injecting themselves weekly with the lowest dose of Wegovy for a month; after that, they can increase the dose monthly until they reach a “maintenance dose.”

When people stop taking Wegovy, they often regain weight. And when patients can only access the medication in fits and starts, they may end up “weight cycling,” a term researchers use to describe fluctuations in weight — which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Some patients end up temporarily taking older weight loss medications like Saxenda as a stopgap, but those alternatives are far less effective and can come with new side effects, Dr. Kraftson said. Others may end up trying to source semaglutide from compounding pharmacies, which can introduce a host of dangers and complications. Patients may want to switch to Ozempic, but that, too, can be hard to find.

Dr. Padmaja Akkireddy, an endocrinologist at Nebraska Medicine, said that when patients stop taking Wegovy for more than a month, she starts them back on a lower dose — which can be disappointing for people looking to lose more weight, and faster.

Others, like Ali Husain, have tried to find workarounds. Mr. Husain, 51, started the medication in March to cut down on weight he had gained earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic. By June, he was only able to find higher doses in stock. When his pharmacy accidentally sent him the highest dose after he spent weeks without the drug, he decided to measure his own lower doses. But after he resumed taking the medication and reached a higher dose, the side effects rattled Mr. Husain, who vomited so intensely that his stomach ached for days.

One reason that patients are advised to follow the strict dosing schedule is to stave off side effects.

“With a higher dose, there’s more weight loss, but also more side effects,” Dr. Hagan said. People can also experience more side effects if they go on and off the medication, Dr. Akkireddy said, because their bodies struggle to recalibrate.

Mr. Husain’s doctor decided to put him back on a lower dose to mitigate his side effects. Hours before he spoke with The New York Times, Mr. Husain received a text from Walgreens. It was out of stock."
"Workers Exposed to Extreme Heat Have Few Protections
Tens of millions of Americans are struggling to cope with soaring temperatures. OSHA is developing new workplace safety standards, but they are not yet complete.

Anthony Soto, a 22-year-old baggage claim employee at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, crumpled to the floor near gate C15 after a seizure last October that he attributed to hot indoor conditions and strenuous lifting. In record-setting heat in Texas this past summer, Mr. Soto, who has epilepsy, had four more seizures that left him speechless, his body unresponsive, he said.

His blue button-down shirt was streaked with sweat on a recent sweltering day as the temperature again neared 105 degrees. Working in such heat “makes us feel unwanted, unhelpful and unworthy,” he said. “The only thing that matters is how long it takes to scan bags.”

Scientists say the record heat this summer was fueled by climate change and that heat waves are likely to grow more intense. But there are few safeguards for tens of millions of workers increasingly exposed to rising temperatures on the job.

The Biden administration is taking steps to create new rules for employers, with two key steps expected in the coming months. A handful of states have put in place standards for work in extreme heat, including California, which requires employers to allow outdoor workers to rest in the shade in temperatures above 80 degrees.

But in other states, workers like Mr. Soto, who makes $15 an hour, continue to suffer as extreme heat spans the summer months and the early fall. Dallas endured a record number of September days with triple-digit temperatures.

“The worst-performing states are just not going to do it on their own,” said Dr. Rosemary Sokas, an occupational health expert at Georgetown University who co-wrote a recent article in The New England Journal of Medicine on the dangers now faced by workers in absence of a federal regulations.

Prodded in 2021 by President Biden, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is drafting guidelines for indoor and outdoor work in heat, which could allow the federal government to fine employers that violate its recommendations.

But OSHA is still plodding through a labyrinthine rule-making process. The agency is required to go through nearly 50 steps, most of which are mandated by executive orders or by congressional legislation.

By the end of October, officials expect to complete a consultation with small businesses that would be affected by the standards. Business groups have opposed the possible rule, saying it could be onerous and expensive. By early next year, the agency could lay out a timeline for a rule proposal.

“That’s really a major milestone, because that’s the spot where the agency formally alerts the public that we are proposing a rule,” Andrew Levinson, OSHA’s director of standards, said in an interview.

Mr. Levinson said that the agency was planning to publish indoor and outdoor standards together, since workers “may be shuffling between outdoor work environments and then going into a warehouse, or into some other equipment processing area.” He added that OSHA had to consider different varieties of hot weather, like dry and moist, and how they affect the body.

The agency’s current guidance for employers, with little enforcement muscle, may offer clues to its formal heat standard. Among the guidelines, experts say, could be acclimatization — the practice of gradually easing workers into schedules that expose them to extreme heat. Many workers who have died from heat-related causes succumbed as they began a job.

The agency could also require employers to offer workers access to breaks, shade and cold water. In a statement to The Times, Mr. Soto’s employer, Prospect Airport Services, said that he had been stationed in a cooler work area and that it had offered additional breaks to employees working in a baggage-handling space where the air-conditioning had been unreliable.

Federal lawmakers introduced legislation over the summer that would require OSHA to publish an emergency rule within a year after the bill passes, a measure seen as unlikely to pass because of opposition in the Republican-controlled House.

One of its chief backers, Representative Greg Casar, Democrat of Texas, held a “thirst strike” over the summer to urge the fast-tracking of an OSHA rule. “It’s critical a rule is laid out over the next year,” he said, adding, “If we want to make it permanent, we need to pass legislation.”

David Michaels, an epidemiologist at George Washington University who led OSHA during the Obama administration, said that the agency’s current timeline suggested that new standards might not come by next year. Whenever it arrives, the rule “would be a game changer,” he said, adding: “There’s no question. And it will save lives.”

Extreme heat especially afflicts low-wage earners like Mr. Soto. In higher temperatures, workers in poor counties lose more of their pay, researchers have found. And low-income Americans disproportionately suffer from chronic health conditions that make them more vulnerable to heat-related injuries.

People with epilepsy are more prone to seizures in extreme heat. so Mr. Soto received permission from his supervisors to work in cooler baggage claim areas. The daily medication he takes has steadied him.

Yet he is still anxious as he navigates the sun-drenched and unreliably air-conditioned airport five days a week, including the long walk to a staff room for lunch that he said eats up much of his break time. The airport’s heat, he said, “feels like you’re in the gym, in the sauna.”

“You fully start sweating. I start looking at my hands and I think, How am I already sweating? I haven’t done anything,” Mr. Soto added. “My uniform, you can literally see the sweat on your back and stomach.”

How heat injures the body
Dangerous heat waves are affecting more of the country, including states with typically milder climates.

The costs to the economy are vast: In 2021, more than 2.5 billion hours of labor in the U.S. agriculture, construction, manufacturing and service sectors were lost to heat exposure, according to data compiled by The Lancet, the London-based medical publication. Productivity dips heavily in hot weather.

Few states offer more vivid examples of these new perils than Texas. More than 40 people have died in Texas from heat-related causes since 2011, including a lineman and letter carrier over the summer.

The risks to workers were apparent on a series of sweltering late summer days at DFW, where temperatures neared 110 degrees.

Over 650,000 Americans worked in commercial airports as of 2022, according to federal data compiled by the Service Employees International Union. Many have jobs that involve full or partial heat exposure, including wheelchair escorts, shuttle drivers and airplane cleaners that can ask for loitering in hot areas without adequate air-conditioning.

Workers on the tarmac, such as baggage handlers, typically face the highest temperatures and most dangerous conditions. While some industries and employers have allowed workers to clock in early in the morning or late at night to avoid the worst of a day’s heat, flight schedules are fixed. Most airport workers cannot choose the time or place for their work.

Travun Watts, a contractor who makes $14 an hour cleaning American Airlines planes at the airport between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m., fainted one afternoon in August as he waited in a jet bridge in scorching weather.

Sitting in a baggage claim area on a recent afternoon before his shift, Mr. Watts, who has diabetes, recalled waking up at a Dallas hospital, uncertain about what had landed him there. “I felt like I was in a loop, incoherent,” he recalled.

To assess the limits of work in extreme heat, scientists point to what is known as the wet-bulb temperature — a measurement of both temperature and humidity. Above 95 degrees, sweat cannot evaporate and the body cannot cool. Hours outdoors can be fatal.

“When you have hot conditions, there’s increased demand on the heart to pump more blood to the largest organ in our body, which is our skin,” said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has studied the environmental health effects of climate change.

Extreme heat can wreak havoc on the body’s major organs. The heart and the kidneys can become deprived of blood and oxygen, leading to kidney failure. If the brain becomes overheated and oxygen-deprived, it can halt the signals to the body to cool itself, preventing sweat.

Mr. Watts spent more than three days in the hospital, he said. A nurse still visits him at home once a week to check on him. His job had been unrelenting even after he returned, he added, often involving cleaning as many as 14 planes per shift.

“Instead of giving me five to 10 minutes to set my insulin meter, they’d rush me, make me run from one plane to next, even when I told them it’s detrimental to my health,” he said.

Airports are particularly risky settings for work, with concrete structures and tarmac that easily retain heat, Dr. Patz noted.

Extreme heat can reduce the safety of indoor spaces by reducing airflow and raising the temperature of air-conditioned spaces. Terminal C, where Mr. Watts works, is older than others at the airport, with crowded walkways, unreliable air-conditioning and drinking fountains with lukewarm water.

At 5:30 p.m. on a recent day, as the temperature hovered around 100 degrees, baggage employees rested their heads and arms on the ramps that funneled bags out of flights in Terminal A.

“Any strenuous activity like throwing luggage on a conveyor belt takes a lot more out of you,” said Dr. Frank LoVecchio, an emergency physician who treated airport workers over the summer at the Valleywise Health Medical Center in Phoenix.

“I’ve seen people super red. They look like they just jumped in a pool,” said Zach Bodine, who makes around $15 an hour helping passengers in wheelchairs at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. He recalled co-workers “throwing up in the bathroom nonstop.”

Mr. Soto, the Dallas baggage claim worker, said that he had considered quitting, a move that could protect his health. But he recalled being a boy who was awe-struck watching planes land at DFW with his father — a feeling that led to his dream of becoming a pilot.

Mr. Soto sometimes rides the airport’s outdoor tram system just to glimpse aircraft. “Everyone wishes they could fly,” he said."
"Gun Deaths Rising Sharply Among Children, Study Finds
Firearm injuries are a leading cause of death among young children and teenagers in the United States.

Julvonnia McDowell was making dinner one evening when she got a call saying that her 14-year-old son, JaJuan — a gentle boy who loved animals, who was so generous that he gave a pair of shoes to a classmate who was being teased — had been shot.

He was visiting a relative’s home when another teenager pulled a gun out from a drawer, where the firearm had been stashed under a T-shirt.

“JaJuan told him to put it away, but the other teenager said that it wasn’t loaded, not realizing it was loaded,” said Ms. McDowell, who lives in Atlanta and has become an advocate for gun safety with the local chapter of Moms Demand Action. “He pulled the trigger, and it hit JaJuan in the chest. JaJuan died 17 minutes later.”

Children are generally medically healthy, which is why accidental injuries pose the greatest threat to their lives. Car accidents have long accounted for the bulk of injury-related fatalities among children.

But according to an analysis published on Thursday, the rate of firearm fatalities among children under 18 increased by 87 percent from 2011 through 2021 in the United States. The death rate attributable to car accidents fell by almost half, leaving firearm injuries the top cause of accidental death in children.

The finding underscores additional data showing that firearm injuries are now the leading cause of death among Americans under 20, after excluding deaths of infants born prematurely or with congenital abnormalities.

Some 2,590 children and teenagers under the age of 18 died of firearm injuries in 2021, up from 1,311 in 2011, according to the study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics. In other industrialized countries, guns are not even among the top three causes of death for children.

Drug poisonings among children younger than 18 more than doubled, and suffocations increased by 12.5 percent, the researchers also found.

Great strides have been made toward protecting children from car accidents and deaths, including mandatory seatbelts, booster seats and airbags, said Dr. Rebekah Mannix, the paper’s lead author and a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Boston Children’s Hospital.

“The opposite is happening with firearms,” she added. “It’s just getting worse, and kids are dying at higher rates from firearms.”

Dr. Mannix’s daughter, Cordelia Mannix, a high school senior, helped with the study, and she is an author of the new paper.

Overall, the rate of nonfatal injuries dropped by more than half among children during the decade studied, from 11,592 per 100,000 to 5,359 per 100,000, while the rate of fatal injuries increased, from 14.07 per 100,000 children to 17.3 per 100,000, the study found.

“Firearms and drug poisonings are both exceptions to this, in that both the nonfatal injuries and the fatal injuries increased,” Ms. Mannix, a student at Middlesex School in Concord, Mass., said.

For both firearm injuries and opioid poisonings, “minutes count, and that’s why the fatality rate is high,” Dr. Toni Gross, medical director of the emergency department at Children’s Hospital New Orleans, said. A child injured by gunfire — in a drive-by shooting, for example, or by shots that pierce the walls of homes — is brought in to the hospital at least once a week, she said.

Firearms can be modified to include safety features like trigger locks that require fingerprint identification, but the firearm industry “has not signed on to making safety modifications,” Dr. Mannix said.

And while many gun owners purchase firearms to protect themselves and their families, research has consistently shown that having a firearm dramatically raises the risk of gun death in the home, both homicides and suicides.

Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the firearm industry, said that it encouraged the safe storage of guns and had partnered with suicide-prevention groups to educate owners about the risk of self-harm.

The firearms industry does not oppose design features that would make guns childproof but does oppose mandates to introduce such features, he said. The group is not currently doing research on making firearms safer.

(One company, Biofire, is marketing a firearm that uses facial recognition and fingerprint technology to ensure that only authorized users can fire a gun.)

State laws can help reduce suicides, according to another recent study carried out by a gun-violence prevention group. A report by Everytown for Gun Safety found that states that are considered leaders in firearm safety have seen a slight drop in the rates of suicides involving guns over the past 20 years. By contrast, states with lax or fewer gun safety laws experienced a 40 percent increase in gun suicide rates between 1999 and 2022.

More than half of the roughly 45,000 gun deaths in the United States are suicides.

The report also found that states with laws like those that hold gun owners accountable for securely storing firearms, or that allow law enforcement to remove guns from people in crisis, saw a 4 percent decline in suicide rates over that period.

In states with the most protective secure storage laws, the gun suicide rate among children and young adults aged 10 to 24 was actually lower in 2022 than in 1999, the report found.

By contrast, in states without secure storage laws or laws that apply only when gun owners recklessly or intentionally give a child a firearm, the gun suicide rate increased by 36 percent among young adults.

More than 4.5 million children live in homes where at least one gun is loaded and not secured, Nick Suplina, Everytown’s senior vice president of law and policy, said. Almost half of suicides among children 10 to 17 years of age are carried out with firearms, Mr. Suplina said.

“That’s exceptionally high, considering this age group is not allowed to possess firearms,” Mr. Suplina said. “We have a real opportunity to keep guns away from this age group by securely storing firearms.”"
"Food Industry Influence Could Cloud the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, a New Report Says
The process of updating the healthy eating recommendations has become more transparent in recent years, but conflicts persist.

It is a long-running concern of government watchdogs: Some of the experts responsible for helping to craft the U.S. dietary guidelines also take money from big food and drug companies.

A report published Wednesday by the nonprofit U.S. Right to Know makes those concerns plain. Nine of the 20 experts on the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee have had conflicts of interest in the food, beverage, pharmaceutical or weight loss industries in the last five years, the report found.

Gary Ruskin, the executive director of the nonprofit, said the finding “erodes confidence in the dietary guidelines,” which provide recommendations on how people can eat a healthier diet. The guidelines are widely used by policymakers to set priorities in federal food programs, health care and education — and questions about industry influence could damage the public’s trust that the recommendations are based in science rather than reflecting corporate interests, Mr. Ruskin said.

What the new report found
For the report, Mr. Ruskin and his colleagues scoured publicly available records and identified financial relationships with industry groups and for-profit food and pharmaceutical companies. Those relationships included research funding from infant formula companies, the U.S. Egg Nutrition Center and the California Walnut Commission; paid consulting positions with companies that manufacture weight loss drugs; and advisory board roles at WeightWatchers and the National Dairy Council.

One committee member, for example, received a $240,000 grant from Eli Lilly, one of the top insulin manufacturers, to research better ways for diabetes patients to manage their blood sugar through their diets.

The current committee members have far fewer industry ties than those in years past, said Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who served on the 1995 committee and is a frequent critic of the guidelines.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services, which jointly revise the dietary guidelines every five years, appointed the current committee members. The members reported their financial disclosures to the agencies, who released a combined list of conflicts for the group — but not for individuals — in June.

Why conflicts of interest are a concern
When committee members receive funding from certain industry groups or organizations, it raises the concern that they may be biased toward them, Dr. Nestle said. “Part of the problem is the influence is unconscious,” she said. “People don’t recognize it,” she added, and will often deny it.

Even if such relationships do not influence the experts, Mr. Ruskin said, they can create the appearance that they do — which can seed doubt about how independent the committee’s recommendations actually are.

Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a current member of the dietary guidelines committee, said it would be difficult to find enough nutrition experts for the 20-member committee who had not taken money from industry groups. Federal funding for nutrition research is limited, he said, and many researchers accept industry grants for research studies so they can keep their jobs in academia. “We have to publish or perish,” Dr. Gardner said.

The Right to Know report identified one major conflict of interest for Dr. Gardner: a research grant from Beyond Meat, which makes plant-based meat alternatives.

Despite that conflict, Dr. Gardner said he believed he could remain objective in his committee duties, which will include reviewing the relationship between what people eat and the risk of various diseases. And, he said, the way the committee evaluates questions of diet and health, including by rigorously reviewing scientific evidence and holding committee discussions and public meetings, would prevent one person’s bias from swaying the committee’s decisions.

“I have full faith that this group is going to very objectively consider all the evidence for every question,” he said.

Even with significant conflicts among members of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dr. Nestle said they did a “pretty good job” of evaluating the evidence. Yet industry influence can still creep in later in the process, she said, when the U.S.D.A. and the H.H.S. produce the final guidelines based on the committee’s advice. The 2020 guidelines, for example, disregarded the committee’s recommendation for stricter limits on sugar and alcohol. And the 2015 edition omitted the committee’s advice on limiting the consumption of red and processed meats after intense lobbying by the meat industry.

Why the Dietary Guidelines are important
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans influence federal policies and food programs, physician guidance and how nutrition is taught in schools. They are also used for meal planning in schools, the military, prisons and hospitals.

“You can’t overestimate how important they are,” Dr. Nestle said.

The current committee is evaluating the research on a number of issues, including on the health effects of ultraprocessed foods, which include most packaged foods and drinks.

That is a topic Dr. Nestle said she would follow with interest, given her concerns that the foods are harmful to people’s health."
"What the Kaiser Permanente Strike Means for Patients
Especially in California, people are experiencing delays in appointments, longer waits for test results and may have medical procedures postponed after thousands of health care workers took part in the second of a three-day walk out.

Tens of thousands of Kaiser Permanente workers, including pharmacists, lab technicians, therapists and housekeepers, went on strike Wednesday morning. The strike continued on Thursday in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington State, so patients in those states could be affected.

Kaiser, whose health plans cover nearly 13 million people through a network of hospitals and clinics, says its hospitals, emergency departments and urgent care centers remain open. But patients should expect delays in scheduling appointments, and procedures that are not considered urgent could be postponed. Doctors and many nurses are not on strike. Kaiser said it would make time available for surgeries in the coming weeks to reschedule any procedures delayed as a result of the strike.

What services are affected?
Many of Kaiser’s labs in California were closed because of the strike, so some tests and results will likely be delayed. An array of other services, like imaging and the filling of prescriptions, could be delayed because of the walkouts. Some clinics and pharmacies could be closed, and Kaiser said it would contact patients with any cancellations.

Kaiser’s hospitals are open. But some people seeking care could be directed to a hospital outside of Kaiser’s usual network if their doctors thought it was necessary. Kaiser’s hospital-based pharmacies also remain open, though the health system is urging people to use its mail order pharmacy if they can wait. Some patients may also be able to go to an outside retail pharmacy to fill a prescription.

Patients may feel the effects of the strike in other ways: Hospital rooms may be cleaned less frequently, and the outside workers that Kaiser has brought in to help may not be as familiar with the way a facility operates.

Where did Kaiser workers walk out?
Kaiser Permanente operates in eight states and the District of Columbia, with 39 hospitals and more than 600 medical offices. Most of the striking workers are in California, where the health system is based.

There are no strikes in Georgia, Maryland and Hawaii, according to Kaiser officials, and few walkouts occurred in Washington State. By Thursday morning, the pharmacists and optometrists who took part in the strike in Virginia and the District of Columbia on Wednesday had returned to work.

What are the main labor issues?
The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated staffing shortages that even Kaiser officials acknowledge still plague hospitals and other medical centers around the country. Patients and workers have had to deal with fewer nurses, aides and support staff members, according to many accounts.

Kaiser’s union representatives said a lack of adequate staffing created unsafe conditions for patients, and argued that better wages would lure workers to close the gaps created by burnout and the exodus of employees in the last few years.

Under a proposed four-year contract, the union had sought a $25 hourly minimum wage and additional increases over the next few years.

Kaiser had countered with minimum hourly wages of between $21 and $23 next year, increasing by a dollar a year and lower raises than the union had sought.

How long will the strike last?
The strike started on Wednesday morning and could last through Saturday morning. A settlement could be reached before then."
"Kaiser Permanente Health Care Workers Begin Strike
The health system failed to reach a new contract agreement with many of its unionized employees, who walked off the job in several states.

More than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente health care workers began a three-day strike Wednesday, a job action that could delay medical appointments, lab results and prescriptions for thousands of patients, especially in California.

Among the union staff members taking part in the walkout were support staff and other employees, like X-ray technicians, receptionists, medical assistants, sanitation workers who disinfect rooms between patients and pharmacy workers who help dispense medications. These workers attend surgeries, run imaging equipment and assist in hundreds of Kaiser’s hospitals and outpatient clinics.

Doctors and many nurses were not involved in the strike, but Kaiser officials warned that some non-urgent procedures like colonoscopies or mammograms might be postponed, some clinic hours might be reduced and that waits on phone calls for assistance could be lengthy. Some sites, mainly labs in places like Anaheim, San Diego and other parts of California were closed, according to Kaiser, and others were operating with reduced hours.

No major disruptions in health care services were reported during the first hours of the strike, and Kaiser officials reiterated that hospitals and emergency rooms, as well as its hospital-based pharmacies, would stay open.

For Kaiser Permanente, whose health plans cover 13 million people in eight states, the widespread labor strike represented a turning point in what has historically been the health system’s relatively amicable relationship with its employees. Union leaders say this may be the largest strike by health care workers in recent U.S. history.

“I’ve been here 33 years and I’ve never seen it like this,” said Lisa Floyd, a lab assistant and a member of the bargaining committee. “Kaiser used to pride itself on being the best place to work and the best place to get care. It doesn’t feel like that anymore. It feels like they’ve lost their way.”

Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Tesla: Weeks after mechanics working for Tesla in Sweden walked off their jobs in late October, members of other unions across the country and elsewhere in Scandinavia have joined the strike in sympathy.
Amazon: More than a year and a half after workers on Staten Island voted to form the company’s first union in the United States, Amazon appears to be taking a harder line toward labor organizing.
Hollywood Actors: SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union, voted to approve a new three-year contract with studios, although some members remained dissatisfied with the deal’s A.I. protections. The ratification formally ended six months of labor unrest in the entertainment industry.
Doctors and Pharmacists: Medical professionals who once escaped the usual labor hierarchy are now unionizing, as the consolidation of health care companies has left them feeling powerless in big bureaucracies.
Negotiations continued on Wednesday, though no reports of progress were issued. The Biden administration’s acting secretary of labor, Julie Su, traveled to San Francisco and has been meeting with officials from both sides of the negotiations in the hotel where the talks were underway, according to multiple members of the bargaining committee. A spokeswoman from the Department of Labor confirmed her involvement.

The frustrations of health care workers have been boiling over across the country, especially since the pandemic highlighted and exacerbated staffing shortages among nurses and led to burnout for many employees. Concerns about patient overloads resulted in a nurses’ strike in New York City in January, and there were more than a dozen similar strikes this year in California, Illinois, Michigan and elsewhere.

More broadly, the tight labor market has emboldened many unionized workers, leading to the recently averted strike at United Parcel Service and current picket lines among autoworkers. “Unions are flexing their muscles in a bunch of industries,” said Ruth Milkman, a professor of sociology and labor studies at the City University of New York.

Outside the West Los Angeles Medical Center, about 750 workers jabbed picket signs in the air and danced to the bass of a DJ beat. Passing trucks honked their horns in support.

Maria Fixico, a laboratory assistant at Kaiser for 12 years, was among the striking workers. She said she arrived at 3 a.m. on Wednesday to complete patient tests before the walkout.

“We know these patients. They were worried. They were asking us, ‘Who is going to take care of us?’” Ms. Fixico said.

Having worked through the “really, really hard” months of the pandemic, Ms. Fixico said her team has often been reduced to three from five members. “We’re here because we love to be here, we love our community,” she said. “But we are so short-staffed.”

The strains of acute staffing shortages contributed to the tensions between the unions and Kaiser executives in the run-up to the contract’s expiration on Saturday. The unions said that Kaiser needed to offer better wages to attract more workers and hire enough people to make up for the exodus of staff during the pandemic.

Mattie Ruffin, 69, a nursing assistant at Kaiser for 17 years, said a lack of adequate staffing had taken a serious toll. When “we’re running room to room, the patients aren’t getting what they need,” Ms. Ruffin said. With so much burnout among workers, “you’re going to see higher hospitalization rates, more infections, more falls,” she said.

In the campus courtyard, security officers stood on every corner, and signs offered apologies to patients for “any inconvenience” caused by rallying union workers.

Among the strikers outside a medical center in San Francisco was Edward Lopez-Matus, a medical assistant who drives for Uber 40 hours a week on top of his full-time job, to make ends meet for his two teenage children.

“My entire paycheck goes to rent,” said Mr. Lopez-Matus, who said a staffing shortage had left him assigned to help two doctors instead of one, increasing the chances that he could make a mistake.

At other sites, workers in Georgia and Hawaii will remain on the job, according to a Kaiser official, and walkouts were expected to be limited in Washington state. In Virginia and the District of Columbia, only pharmacists and optometrists were striking on Wednesday for one day. Maryland workers did not take part.

How much progress had been made on wage talks was not made public. In earlier proposals considered for a new four-year contract, the union had sought a $25 hourly minimum wage and increases of 7 percent in the first two years and 6.25 percent in the two years after, according to a recent proposal.

Kaiser had countered with minimum hourly wages of between $21 and $23 next year, increasing by a dollar per year. Raises would vary among locations.

Many nurses are represented by other unions, including the California Nurses Association, which agreed to a new contract in Northern California last December.

Although the strike was expected to last no more than three days, it was likely to cause Kaiser to lose revenue, according to Kevin Holloran, a senior director at Fitch Ratings.

“Kaiser will respond by keeping critical infrastructure open, but absent plans to backfill striking team members with temporary help, the strike will very likely result in canceled procedures, reduced volumes and a brief but sharp decline on provider revenues this week,” he said in an email.

"The Mystery of My Burning Esophagus
As a science writer, I’ve spent years covering the rise of allergic conditions. Why couldn’t I figure out my own?

My year of torment began with a brutal headache. The pain came on gradually over several weeks, as if some part of my brain were being slowly squeezed in a vise. Darkness lapped at the edge of my vision. Over-the-counter painkillers didn’t help. Occasionally, a dementia-like loss of vocabulary struck, often when I was talking to people over the phone. I found myself unable to recall easy things like “Washington, D.C.” or “George Clooney.” I’d end up staring at my computer without any inkling of what I’d sat down to do.

I suspected something was wrong with my sinuses because I had sinus infections in the past, and this headache was accompanied by a waterfall of mucus running down the back of my throat: postnasal drip, in medical parlance. I figured it wasn’t Covid, which a test eventually confirmed.

When I went to the only ear, nose and throat doctor who could fit me into her schedule, she gently inserted a long, flexible rubber scope into my nose to examine my sinuses. As I sneezed and gagged, she pushed the scope farther, to peer down my throat. I might have reflux, she said — acid splashing up from my stomach into my esophagus. She could see “damage” in my pharynx. She seemed unconcerned, though. Some people have terrible reflux but don’t feel a thing, she said; others have a little reflux, and it causes intense discomfort. I must belong to the former group, if my throat looked like this and I wasn’t feeling pain there now. She prescribed a course of antibiotics to clear out whatever nasty microbes might have established themselves in my sinuses, the presumed source of my pain.

Unfortunately, something was starting to disturb my insides. It began as a faint sensation of heat under my sternum and over several weeks grew stronger, until it felt as if some part of me had caught fire. The sensation reached an apogee one night following a meal of greasy quesadillas with hot peppers. After that, I changed my diet, abandoned coffee and avoided heavy foods, all said to aggravate reflux. But whatever was happening to me only got worse. Warmth began to rise in my throat soon after every meal, no matter how light or bland the food. To avoid the feeling of lava bubbling up within me, I ate as little as possible. I started to lose weight.

I didn’t know it at the time, but I was embarking on a journey into territory I knew well. My ailment, it would turn out, was of a piece with a much larger development in affluent countries over the past 150 years or so. As improved sanitation, vaccines, antibiotics and other innovations beat back infectious diseases, some chronic diseases have been on the rise, including disorders in which the very immune system meant to protect us turns on us instead. A leading explanation for such self-sabotage involves the changes we have wrought on our microbiomes, the communities of microbes living in and on our bodies. As a science writer, I’d covered this phenomenon extensively. But despite having written a book about some of the diseases involved and the reasons for their increasing prevalence, I hadn’t ever considered how they could lead to the kind of unremitting pain that was making my life so miserable now at 47.

I had to call several gastroenterology clinics to find a doctor who could perform an endoscopy reasonably soon. The procedure, which often involves sedation so that a thin tube with a tiny camera at the end can be pushed down the throat, revealed that my esophagus had abnormal rings — swellings — over its entire length, like a corrugated drainpipe. The doctor, my first gastroenterologist, said he couldn’t be certain, but those rings seemed to indicate a rare allergic condition called eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).

Eosinophils are specialized white blood cells that help repel intestinal parasites and bacteria. They can also play a role in various allergic diseases, including asthma and eczema. In my case, though biopsies showed elevated eosinophil numbers, they were below the cutoff used to diagnose EoE. But there was a confounding factor: To treat my presumed reflux, a week earlier I started taking Prilosec, an over-the-counter antacid drug that can also suppress eosinophils. It was impossible, in other words, to say whether I had an allergic condition obscured by the medication, or simply an unusual case of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.

But a definitive diagnosis didn’t really matter, the doctor explained, because EoE and severe reflux are both treated with Prilosec or other drugs in the same class called proton pump inhibitors, or P.P.I.s. These medications suppress the production of the stomach acid that helps digest food. He recommended that I quadruple the dosage.

Most people take the drug without problems — P.P.I.s are widely used — but for me the side effects of such a high dose were horrendous. I couldn’t see straight or read very well. I couldn’t concentrate. Worst of all was a bone-crushing fatigue. Getting up from the couch became a groan-inducing ordeal of unsteadiness. My doctor said I’d have to be on this medicine for at least eight weeks.

If everything was better, why did I still feel so miserable?
Unable to work, I ended up spending the better part of two months lying in the hammock in my tiny backyard. I could no longer tolerate food with strong flavors, so I subsisted on brown rice, lentils, steamed vegetables and small amounts of chicken breast. At some point, my wedding band slipped off my thinning fingers, lost without my realizing it. One evening, my 10-year-old daughter, the eldest of my three children, burst into tears and said, “I just want you to get better!”

But my condition worsened. Increasingly I felt as if I couldn’t breathe. I had severe asthma as a child, but the disease hadn’t troubled me greatly since then. Now, however, my breathing became more labored. The usual inhalers didn’t help. The bottom half of my lungs seemed to be filled with cement. And then, starting one morning in July 2021, the gasping attacks began.

Every other day or so, an acute feeling of suffocation overwhelmed me. These attacks left me hot, panicked and sweaty. The fastest way to quell them, I discovered, was to sit in front of an air-conditioning unit going full blast and hold my breath for as long as I could. Somehow that calmed what I began to suspect was a problem with my nervous system.

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and by now I had a new gastroenterologist, a doctor at Stanford Health Care, affiliated with the university and a specialist in EoE. The burning sensation had me convinced that I suffered from severe reflux. But she told me that all the acid-suppressing medicine I was taking — she’d advised me to add a few other types to the mix — meant my stomach probably wasn’t making much acid at all; acid in my esophagus was not causing the pain, most likely. Even so, she ordered tests to confirm her thinking. A pill-shaped gizmo inserted into my lower esophagus was used to measure acidity; another tube of sensors measured how well the sphincter that separated the stomach from the esophagus, which was essential in preventing stomach acid from splashing backward, squeezed shut.

The results of these and other exams were both reassuring and baffling: Everything appeared to be working normally. The pressure of my lower esophageal sphincter was fine; the wavelike motion of swallowing, called peristalsis, was normal. There was no acid reflux. The ringlike swellings in my esophagus had faded. The number of allergic eosinophil cells had declined. I faced a conundrum: If everything was better, why did I still feel so miserable?

During my years of interviewing doctors, I haven’t been able to help noticing the exasperation some of them feel toward patients who look for medical guidance online — what one of those physicians once called Dr. Google — and then come into the office making demands based on what is often incomplete information or outright misinformation. I tried to walk a fine line with my doctors, pointing out that I was a science writer (blank stares), and that I read a lot of scientific articles (more blank stares, now tinged with apparent dread). I wanted them to know they were the bosses. I just had lots of questions.

Convinced that I had an extreme case of GERD, I compiled a list of surgeries and procedures used to tighten or repair the lower esophageal sphincter. I contacted specialists in the breathing problems associated with GERD. I looked into alternative treatments: the sleep aid melatonin; acupuncture; a new acid-suppressing drug first introduced in Japan. My research helped in some areas. It was because of what I had learned about EoE that I left my first gastroenterologist, who didn’t seem to know much about the condition.

Yet the endless quest for answers also spiraled into a kind of madness. An ever-expanding decision tree paralyzed me. If it was X, then I’d do Y surgery. If it was A, then I’d take B drug. I was driving myself nuts with all that reading, my wife said. But if I didn’t do this research, I countered, who would?

My new gastroenterologist had a theory to explain the all-consuming pain under my sternum. Sometimes patients develop a hypersensitivity syndrome, she told me. The original insult — in my case, inflammation of some kind — might be long gone, but the nerves that convey pain can become overactive and begin firing at the slightest provocation. When this happens, stimuli you normally wouldn’t even notice can cause extreme pain. I was skeptical. The pain felt exactly as if my esophagus were being burned by, yes, hydrochloric stomach acid. How could it be some kind of sensory hallucination?

She explained it as “a headache of the esophagus.” And that “headache” might be treatable with an unlikely approach: neuromodulating drugs that were first developed to manage depression. Scientists don’t completely understand how antidepressants help pain syndromes, but certain ones seem to impede pain signals in the nervous system. There were two kinds on offer, she informed me: one that might give me diarrhea but also energy, or another that could make me tired and constipated.

No contest: I requested diarrhea with energy.

The drug, an antidepressant called duloxetine — one of its brand names is Cymbalta — increases in the brain levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine, chemical messengers that can help modulate pain signals. I didn’t get energy or diarrhea from the duloxetine, however. Instead, I became dizzy and nauseated. Food tasted off. Anything with a soft texture triggered a sense of revulsion.

After a few weeks, those side effects faded. And that’s when things began to turn around. I could tolerate more and different kinds of food. Cheese and eggs. A tart apple. One day, after several weeks of feeling better, I ate so much that the burning pain came roaring back. My doctor recommended that I double my duloxetine dose. The improvements accelerated.

After six months on the P.P.I.s that made me feel half dead, my gastroenterologist granted my wish to stop taking them. In early 2022, another endoscopy and another acidity study finally, almost a year after the ordeal began, yielded a conclusive diagnosis. Once I was off the P.P.I.s, the corrugated drainpipe-like swellings returned, just without the pain, thanks to the duloxetine. My eosinophil counts, detected in little plugs of flesh the doctor took from my esophageal lining, had skyrocketed. I had eosinophilic esophagitis. My food pipe had been chronically inflamed by an allergic reaction, most likely in response to some food I was eating.

As many as one in every 1,000 Americans, according to recent studies, is afflicted with eosinophilic esophagitis, making it rare but not vanishingly so. Although the condition is somewhat obscure, I learned about it years earlier, while researching my 2012 book “An Epidemic of Absence,” which explores the reasons behind the rise of allergic and autoimmune diseases in affluent societies. I had seen it mentioned as one more example of the growing number and variety of allergic diseases we seem prone to developing. I was also, I knew by now, very likely predisposed to develop EoE: male, asthmatic and already allergic to two foods that I knew of (peanuts and sesame make me vomit), all conditions that occur more frequently in people with EoE than those without. In a way, the discovery that I had EoE felt like a diagnosis preordained, like a biological fate.

The bigger issue, the one that inspired my book, was the question of where diseases like this came from. Hay fever, one of the most common allergic diseases, seemed to become more prevalent in the late 19th century, as did asthma in the mid-to-late 20th century. But EoE was first understood as a type of food allergy only in the 1990s, after which diagnoses began to increase. While this change probably stemmed in part from doctors’ greater awareness of the disease, research led by Evan S. Dellon, a gastroenterologist who specializes in EoE at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, suggests that the disease has in fact become more common. When he and his colleagues analyzed Danish records of biopsies taken between 1997 and 2012, they did indeed find that the rate of biopsies — a signal of how often doctors were looking for EoE — doubled. Yet test results and symptoms indicative of EoE rose nineteenfold, far outpacing the jump in biopsies. More recent studies have reached a similar conclusion.

When the incidence of a noninfectious disease changes so quickly — faster than our genomes can possibly accumulate new mutations that increase susceptibility — scientists suspect that changes in the environment are responsible. And studies involving twins point to an environmental trigger for EoE. According to one paper on both identical and fraternal twins, just 14.5 percent of the risk was attributable to genetics, with the rest determined by the twins’ surroundings. “We think it’s something in the prenatal environment,” says Amanda Muir, a pediatric gastroenterologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, referring to in utero exposures.

Other possible factors include common chemicals, like pesticides and food additives. For one Mayo Clinic study published earlier this year, scientists induced eosinophilic inflammation in the esophagi of mice merely by giving them drinking water with a small amount of detergent in it. The soap used in the study, sodium dodecyl sulfate, is an ingredient in some toothpastes and dish soaps. None of these possible explanations for EoE are mutually exclusive. Its causes are most likely multifactorial, Dellon says, with several simultaneous “hits,” as he calls them, required to induce the disease.

Changes to the microbiome, which can occur for all sorts of reasons, also seem to be a major factor making people susceptible to EoE. Elizabeth Jensen, an associate professor of epidemiology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and her colleagues have found that having been breastfed — which, along with its other benefits, is thought to cultivate a healthier microbial garden in the infant gut — is protective against the disease, for example, but so far only in children with certain gene variants suspected of making the esophageal barrier more permeable. Jensen, who suffers from EoE herself, thinks that one explanation for this finding is that by nudging children’s microbiomes in a healthier direction, breastfeeding blunts their chances of developing EoE.

Conversely, antibiotics taken early in life are associated with an increased risk of EoE later, according to Jensen’s research (a pattern also observed in studies of those with asthma, pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease and pediatric autoimmune arthritis). That’s probably for exactly the opposite reason: Along with the targeted pathogen, the medicine can kill off protective microbes. On the whole, Jensen’s findings suggest that it may not be some new environmental exposure alone that is driving the rise of EoE but also that we are peeling away layers of protection — and in some cases may never acquire that protection at all — by having changed what microbes live around, in and on our bodies.

Here, Jensen’s research intersects with a much larger body of science that is sometimes misleadingly labeled the “hygiene hypothesis,” though it has nothing to do with personal hygiene. The research posits that the rise of allergic diseases over the past 150 years, and the apparent increase in many autoimmune disorders as well, may be evidence of a single phenomenon: a population-wide derangement of our microbial communities and the immune systems these communities train — a single problem, but one that expresses itself in many different ways.

By late autumn in 2021, nine months into my ailment, I faced a new difficulty. The duloxetine never delivered on the promised energy (or diarrhea). But it did cause drenching night sweats and sleepiness. I was constantly yawning. And somewhere along the way, I lost all drive to do much of anything. The antidepressant was, I surmised, depressing me. I had to continue taking it, I knew, to keep the horrible pain at bay, but I yearned for an “upper,” some kind of stimulant. I asked my doctors to prescribe a drug that would animate me — Ritalin, perhaps. They were hesitant to prescribe a habit-forming medicine to counter the side effects of another drug and recommended evaluation by a psychiatrist instead.

After much searching — the surge in mental-health troubles during the pandemic was keeping psychiatrists booked up — I found one who could see me over Zoom. He prescribed a drug called bupropion, which affects the dopamine pathways in the brain that underlie our sense of motivation and reward. (It’s also used to help people stop smoking.) Bupropion can cause dry mouth and insomnia, but I didn’t develop these side effects, thankfully, and the medicine ended up being miraculous. Very quickly, I could focus again. I cared about things. When I told my sister about this pill, she said, half-jokingly, “Can I have that psychiatrist’s number?”

I saw disparate-seeming episodes that had distressed me going back decades in a new light.
There were no F.D.A.-approved treatments for EoE itself. The available treatments were off-label, consisting of drugs primarily prescribed for other conditions. I hadn’t tolerated the high doses of P.P.I.s, the usual first treatment, so in February 2022, I began swallowing liquid steroids meant to be inhaled as an asthma treatment; I mixed the medicine with honey to help it stick to my esophageal wall. According to biopsies taken soon after, from the fourth endoscopy within a year’s time, the medicine did a good job of controlling the allergic inflammation.

Steroids can cause cataracts, osteoporosis and other complications if used in excess or for too long. But the type I’ve been taking for over a year and a half, called budesonide, is formulated to be topical; supposedly only a minimal amount enters circulation. Eventually I hope to identify the food I’m allergic to so I can avoid it and stop the steroids completely. But because skin-prick tests and blood tests, the usual ways of identifying an allergy, do not work well for EoE — neither test really measures what eosinophils are specifically doing in your esophagus, the location of this disorder — the only reliable way to identify an allergen is to eliminate certain food groups and then examine the esophagus directly to see if the inflammation has improved, followed by additional endoscopies as you reintroduce each food group. The onerous process can require many months to complete, and depending on what foods turn out to trigger an allergy, they can be hard to avoid anyway. So my gastroenterologist and I decided that for the time being, I would continue treating the EoE with steroids.

In May 2022, the F.D.A. approved the first drug for EoE. Called Dupixent, it inhibits two immune-signaling proteins that help drive the type of allergic inflammation underlying EoE. I was raring to get on the stuff; I’d been reading about it in journal articles and on medical news sites for months. But after learning about its potential downsides — including the activation of herpes virus infections, a rash, eye inflammation and the possibility that it might not be covered by insurance — I held off. With any new drug, my doctor pointed out, “you don’t want to be first. You want to be next.”

Now that I knew what ailed me, and had a treatment regimen that was at least controlling the problem, I saw disparate-seeming episodes that had distressed me going back decades in a new light: a painful lump in my throat in my 20s that I attributed to stress; an occasional sensation of breathlessness, also in my 20s, that I thought was allergies. All along, some still unidentified food was probably inflaming my esophagus.

The long lag time between the appearance of symptoms and a diagnosis wasn’t unusual, I learned. Evan Dellon of U.N.C.’s medical school told me that the lag time for diagnosing this condition typically ranges between five and eight years. People with EoE often have difficulty swallowing food years before they know what the cause is. They may develop unconscious coping mechanisms, reflexively avoiding mealy potatoes, say, or gristly steak. I had developed my own workarounds. After choking on a Tylenol pill years ago, for example, I started crushing all pills before swallowing them so they wouldn’t stick.

Perhaps because of the constant fear of choking, esophagitis is closely linked with anxiety and depression. More than a quarter of adults with EoE take anti-anxiety or antidepressant drugs — a “really striking finding,” Dellon says. Food, he says, should never catch in your esophagus, a long flexible and muscular tube that extends down from the throat and that, when healthy, should be stretchy and well lubricated enough to pass large blobs of chewed-up stuff. “Nothing is normal about food sticking,” he says.

The burning pain I felt wasn’t unusual, either, Dellon told me. He pointed to animal experiments that showed how an allergy could, over time, lead to a pain syndrome. Scientists induced EoE in guinea pigs and let it progress for a while. The chronic allergic inflammation in their esophagi eventually heightened the sensitivity of nearby nerve cells to painful stimuli. In Dellon’s experience with people, that sort of hypersensitivity can persist long after the inflammation has resolved. “That’s what I see relatively commonly in patients,” he said. Everything looks normal. No swelling. Biopsies show a reduction in eosinophils. But the patients complain of persistent pain.

Doctors are increasingly aware of these kinds of pain syndromes in many disorders, including GERD. The condition, whose primary symptom is known colloquially as heartburn, is pervasive, afflicting an estimated one in five Americans. Some of these patients continue to feel intense pain even after their stomach acid has been reduced with antacids, a malady most likely caused by a hypersensitivity syndrome similar to mine. Ronnie Fass, the medical director of the Digestive Health Center at MetroHealth in Cleveland, argues that the treatment of GERD-like symptoms should accommodate this new understanding: Neuromodulators should be considered right away for those experiencing esophageal pain. “We should not wait until patients fail treatment to identify that esophageal hypersensitivity plays an important role,” he told me. Unfortunately, he adds, patients often refuse antidepressants because in their minds, using psychiatric medicine means they’re mentally ill. They tend to request opiates instead.

As for the air hunger I experienced, my gastroenterologist rejected any connection to my esophageal problems. I’d sent her articles on how reflux disease could worsen asthma, trying to convince her that the two could be linked. Because the megadose of P.P.I.s I was taking at the time meant my stomach probably hadn’t been producing enough acid to irritate my esophagus, my breathing difficulties more likely stemmed from an allergic reaction to something in the environment, she said, because I was clearly an allergy-prone fellow. I didn’t press her on this, but I didn’t completely agree with that reasoning. To my mind, it didn’t matter whether irritation was actually occurring. What mattered was whether my nervous system thought it was. That had been the great lesson of my pain syndrome: The burning sensation persisted even when the disease that caused it had quieted down.

Indeed, the breathing problems began to improve only once I started the duloxetine, suggesting (to me, at any rate) that the issues with my lungs, like the pain syndrome, emanated from a nervous system at cross purposes with itself. Yet when I began asking experts how these things might be related, several of them noted that reflux could exacerbate asthma or cause a sensation of breathlessness, but there wasn’t enough data to say the same about EoE. When I brought up my episodes of feeling suffocated, the scientists waffled. I got the sense that they thought I was really having panic attacks.

It wasn’t until I called Brendan Canning, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins, that I found someone willing to speculate how an allergy in the esophagus might lead to the terrifying sensation of drowning. Canning, a self-described “science nerd,” is not a physician but a researcher who focuses on allergies and airways. He explained to me that the nerves that transmit pain, air hunger and other information from our organs lead, like telegraph lines, to very primitive parts of the brain that are physically near one another. Because of this proximity, the neurons receiving signals sometimes have a hard time determining precisely where the message is coming from. It might be that any irritation in the esophagus, whether from an upward surge of acid or inflammation spurred by a food allergy, could be interpreted as originating in the lungs — or even the heart — and a body might respond, as mine apparently did, with the panic of someone who’s drowning. “It’s not surprising that this could happen,” Canning said, given “the tremendous overlap that exists in the brain stem.”

Why has there been no moonshot program to conquer allergic disease? Eosinophilic esophagitis is rare, but allergic diseases as a group include the itchy skin of eczema, the hives and vomiting of food allergies, the runny noses of hay-fever season, the breathing problems of allergic asthma and more. They afflict nearly one in three Americans, making life miserable for vast swaths of the population. And if the microbiome has been implicated for so long in these ailments — and now in EoE — why is it taking so long for a microbiome-targeting therapy to become available? “We’re wondering about that, too,” Alkis Togias, the chief of the Allergy, Asthma and Airway Biology Branch at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told me. In recent years, the institute has fielded only a few applications for microbiome-related studies, he says — far fewer than anticipated. Scientists aren’t convinced that they have identified the right microbes, he suspects. But Togias says that the agency is taking the allergy problem seriously and that funding for the study of food allergies, for example, has risen to between $60 million and $80 million per year now from $1.3 million in 2003. “It’s a very big jump,” he says. “But I totally agree with you. It should be more.”

Much of the science on the microbiome suggests that what you encounter early in life sets the tone for how your immune system works later, so many in the field understandably focus on prevention, rather than on how to correct an already-dysfunctional community of microbes. But a few researchers have been pursuing the prospect of changing those adult microbiomes as well.

A few years ago, Rima Rachid, the director of the Allergen Immunotherapy Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, and her colleagues gave 10 adult volunteers with peanut allergies microbes from nonallergic donors. The subjects ingested, in capsule form, carefully screened feces from healthy people in order to see if the microbes it contained could give them relief from nut allergies. After four months, three subjects could tolerate at least three times the amount of peanut protein compared with amounts that originally triggered reaction. That translated to a little more than one peanut. Three out of five other patients who, before swallowing the capsules, took antibiotics, presumably clearing out their own distorted microbiomes and making it easier for the new ones to establish themselves, could tolerate more than two peanuts’ worth of protein.

The study was tiny, lacked a control group and was hardly conclusive. (A follow-up study is underway with children.) And EoE doesn’t work exactly like these more common nut allergies. But the research gives people like me, adults with established allergic disease, reason to hope. “I don’t think you can say that once your microbiome is formed, you’ve lost hope,” Rachid told me. “There is a possibility of changing the microbiome.”

There may also be a new class of microbe-inspired medicine on the horizon, a drug that doesn’t even have a name, just a number: ‘1104. Early studies suggest it reduces eosinophils in patients with EoE, as well as other white blood cells that contribute to the disease. It also increases patients’ own “regulatory” T cells and B cells, which are thought to be crucial in preventing the inappropriate immune aggression that underlies many allergic diseases.

The drug is based on a molecule derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis. The bacterium can establish long-term infection in the body by suppressing the immune system. Some studies have observed that people carrying latent TB infections appear to have a lower risk of developing asthma, as do those who have been vaccinated against TB. Revolo Biotherapeutics, the company developing ‘1104, is seeking to leverage the bacterium’s ability to “reset” the immune system. If further human trials pan out, maybe we’re headed toward a new generation of drugs derived from our interactions with microbes that inhabit our bodies.

In June 2022, I decided I’d had enough of duloxetine. It proved pivotal to my recovery, but after 10 months of constant exhaustion — I’d stopped the bupropion, which turned out to irritate my esophagus — I was ready to be weaned off it. My psychiatrist warned me about possible withdrawal symptoms, including “zapping” sensations akin to electric shocks. The warning didn’t quite prepare me. The “electric” shocks were more like being struck unconscious for a millisecond while cold, blue flames rushed up my backbone.

For about a week, the side effects were intense enough that I considered resuming the duloxetine. (As it happens, Eli Lilly, the company that first manufactured duloxetine, has been repeatedly sued by patients claiming that it hadn’t given them full warning about the difficulty of discontinuing the antidepressant.) Happily though, the worst of the symptoms began to fade after about two weeks. And I no longer felt as if I was constantly fighting the urge to nap, which was encouraging. My mind felt less enveloped in cobwebs. And the burning pain remained quiescent.

I was not cured, just much better. I occasionally felt nagging pain under my sternum. I still couldn’t eat certain foods, particularly the spicy cuisine I used to adore, and the heavy, greasy foods loved by many. My breathing still felt off sometimes, as if I couldn’t fully inhale. But there were periodic moments when I felt better than I had in a long time, presumably because I was finally treating a disease that had been on a slow burn for years, maybe decades.

And then this past February, about seven months after my last dose of duloxetine, the burning returned. The paradox was that even though I was now treating the EoE with steroids, I felt pain as if the disease were raging uncontrolled. Evidently my nervous system could be easily reactivated to produce this burning sensation. I went back on the duloxetine, although this time a much lower dose did the trick.

I often remind myself how fortunate I’ve been. Because of my work as a science writer, I already had some familiarity with EoE and I was relatively comfortable navigating the byzantine medical system and advocating for myself. My wife has a well-paying job that allowed me to stop working for a year and not worry too much about finances or health insurance. New treatments are either available or in development for a disorder doctors barely understood just three decades ago.

Still, any disease in which the body overreacts (allergy) or turns against itself (autoimmunity) is bound to inspire a unique kind of desperation. Those of us in this club we never asked to join have bodies that are, in ways both literal and figurative, self-lacerating. Our magnificent and complicated bodily defenses, our immune systems, instead torment us. What we yearn for is a single treatment that can, once and for all, correct this wayward tendency toward self-destruction.

"A New Way to Prevent S.T.I.s: A Pill After Sex

The News
In a bid to stem the resurgence of sexually transmitted infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to recommend doxycycline, a widely used antibiotic, for use after an unprotected sexual encounter.

The antibiotic would be taken only by gay and bisexual men and transgender women who have had an S.T.I. within the previous year or who may be at risk for one. The scientific evidence is too limited to recommend the strategy, called doxy-PEP, to all people who might be exposed to infection-causing bacteria during sex.

The agency released draft guidelines on Monday and plans to finalize them after a 45-day public comment period.

Why It Matters: Rates of S.T.I.s are skyrocketing.
In 2021, there were 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, more than 700,000 cases of gonorrhea and nearly 177,000 cases of syphilis in the United States, together tallying up to $1.1 billion in direct medical costs. (Rates of babies born with syphilis also soared that year, with nearly 3,000 affected.)

All three S.T.I.s are caused by bacteria and are easily treated with antibiotics. But the closure of sexual health clinics across the country and a drop in public awareness has contributed to a sharp rise in infections.

Gonorrhea cases have increased 118 percent since a historical low in 2009, according to the C.D.C. Syphilis was nearly eliminated in the United States about 20 years ago, but cases have risen 74 percent since 2017.

On any given day in 2018, about one in five Americans had an S.T.I., the C.D.C. has estimated.

“We need game-changing innovations to turn the S.T.I. epidemic around, and this is a major step in the right direction,” Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the agency’s National Center for H.I.V., Viral Hepatitis, S.T.D. and TB Prevention, said in an emailed statement.

Background: Doxycycline is a powerful deterrent of infection.
The C.D.C.’s guidelines are based on studies that show that a single dose of doxycycline taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex dramatically cuts the risk of the infections.

Evidence from emerging research was compelling enough that clinics in some cities, such as San Francisco, have been offering doxy-PEP to those at high risk of infection for months. Generally, patients are given a supply of pills and told to take one within three days of an encounter during which they might have become infected.

But rates of S.T.I.s are highest among Black people and Native Americans, who are often those with the least access to health care. “No prevention tool — no matter how powerful — will change the S.T.I. epidemic if it doesn’t reach the people who need it most,” Dr. Mermin said.

What Critics Say: Wider antibiotic use may pose risks.
Doxycycline has been in use for decades, and there are few indications that bacteria have become resistant to it. Syphilis and chlamydia do not often develop resistance, but gonorrhea is another question: Those bacteria have become resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics.

Still, the picture may change depending on how many people take doxy-PEP and how often, some experts cautioned.

“At the population level, that does worry me,” said Antón Castellanos Usigli, a sexual health expert who is an adjunct lecturer at the Columbia Mailman School of Health.

In places like his native Mexico, Dr. Castellanos Usigli said, indiscriminate use of antibiotics has fueled the rise of drug-resistant bacteria and can also alter a person’s gut microbiome.

What Happens Next: The C.D.C. will finalize new guidelines.
Evidence so far supports doxy-PEP’s use only in men who have sex with men and in transgender women. In those groups, the antibiotic cut rates of syphilis and chlamydia by about 90 percent and gonorrhea by about 55 percent.

Men who have sex with men account for nearly half of reported syphilis cases, according to the C.D.C. If studies show the approach to be effective in heterosexual cisgender men and cisgender women, the guidelines may be expanded.

The agency said doctors should prescribe doxy-PEP as part of a comprehensive sexual health program that includes counseling, screening and treatment for the infections and for H.I.V.

“Doxy-PEP will be a good option for some patients,” Dr. Castellanos Usigli said. “But we will have to do a lot of education with medical providers and patients so that we target the best candidates and prevent misuse and overuse.”"
"Kaiser Permanente Workers Poised to Strike
The health care system provides care for 13 million people in eight states. Union officials say the job action — threatened for Wednesday — could be the largest strike by health care workers in recent U.S. history.

More than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente employees are threatening to walk out Wednesday morning if they cannot agree to a new labor contract. The previous contract expired on Saturday. Union leaders say this could be the largest strike by health care workers in recent U.S. history.

Kaiser, a large nonprofit health system, provides care for 13 million people in eight states, including California, Colorado and Washington, and the District of Columbia. The job action would involve support and other staff, including X-ray and lab technicians; sanitation workers who disinfect rooms between patients; and pharmacy workers who help dispense medications. These workers attend surgeries, run imaging equipment and assist in outpatient clinics. Doctors and many nurses are not part of the strike, which is set to last three days in some places. Some nurses, therapists and aides could also walk out.

Kaiser said it was preparing for a possible strike and would do what it could to minimize any disruptions to patients. “Our hospitals are going to remain open,” including the emergency departments, said Michelle Gaskill-Hames, regional president for Kaiser Permanente in Southern California and Hawaii.

But patients could experience delays in getting appointments, or procedures that are not considered urgent could be postponed.

The strains of an acute staffing shortage have led union officials to warn that the strike is likely if Kaiser executives ignore their concerns. Workers say the lack of adequate staffing at Kaiser facilities is creating unsafe conditions for patients. The unions say that Kaiser needs better wages to attract workers and that it needs to hire enough people to make up for the exodus of staff during the pandemic.

Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Tesla: Weeks after mechanics working for Tesla in Sweden walked off their jobs in late October, members of other unions across the country and elsewhere in Scandinavia have joined the strike in sympathy.
Amazon: More than a year and a half after workers on Staten Island voted to form the company’s first union in the United States, Amazon appears to be taking a harder line toward labor organizing.
Hollywood Actors: SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union, voted to approve a new three-year contract with studios, although some members remained dissatisfied with the deal’s A.I. protections. The ratification formally ended six months of labor unrest in the entertainment industry.
Doctors and Pharmacists: Medical professionals who once escaped the usual labor hierarchy are now unionizing, as the consolidation of health care companies has left them feeling powerless in big bureaucracies.
“It’s so disappointing to see them falling down here,” said Caroline Lucas, the executive director of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, the collection of a dozen unions that notified Kaiser last month about the possibility of a strike. The coalition represents about half of Kaiser’s unionized work force, largely in California, where Kaiser is based.

While the pandemic caused an immediate crisis in which workers were stretched too thin, Ms. Lucas said employees had been concerned about short staffing even before Covid hit. “For years, there has been a crisis on the horizon,” she said.

Negotiations are continuing through midday Tuesday. “We are committed to staying at the table as long as we need to,” Ms. Gaskill-Hames said.

She said Kaiser was grappling with the same staffing problems as other health systems across the country. The group has fared better than many of its competitors, she said, in limiting turnover and hiring replacement staff. “We have really ramped up on aggressive retention and recruitment strategies,” Ms. Gaskill-Hames said.

The frustrations of health care workers, who feel they are being forced to care for too many patients for too little pay, have been boiling over across the country. Many of the workers who remain feel burned out and are struggling to handle a higher volume of patients. The concern over inadequate staffing resulted in a nurses’ strike in New York City in January, and there were more than a dozen similar strikes this year in California, Illinois, Michigan and elsewhere.

The tight labor market has emboldened many unionized workers, leading to the recently averted strike at United Parcel Service and current picket lines among autoworkers. “Unions are flexing their muscles in a bunch of industries,” said Ruth Milkman, a professor of sociology and labor studies at the City University of New York.

The pervasive short staffing in health care gives workers significant leverage to demand better working conditions and higher pay, she said.

Many nurses are represented by other unions, including the California Nurses Association, which agreed to a new contract in Northern California last December.

The high levels of burnout have exacerbated the staffing shortages, said Ethan Ruskin, a health educator at Kaiser Permanente in San Jose, Calif. Patients have to wait longer than usual for appointments, he said, only to face more delays in the waiting rooms.

“If they see something on your mammogram and send you for a sonogram, you’re going to be waiting weeks for a scan,” Mr. Ruskin said. “Meanwhile our sonographers have huge injury rates — things like stress fractures — because they are expected to see twice as many patients as they should.”

Mr. Ruskin, who works alongside doctors to educate patients about various diagnoses, such as diabetes, said employees in San Jose had been frustrated by their working conditions for more than three years. “The executives could stop the strike today, frankly,” Mr. Ruskin said. “To be clear, nobody wants to go out on strike. But we’re prepared to. We get into this field because we want to help people. We’re not sure what else to do at this point.”

Kaiser released a video and other resources in recent weeks to urge workers to push back on union calls for a strike. They argue that, in contrast to other high-profile labor negotiations, such as those among autoworkers and Hollywood actors, the effects of a health worker strike on the public would be immediate and life-threatening. The unions, however, have said that a strike is necessary to protect patient safety.

As the talks continue, the sides have yet to agree on a minimum hourly wage for workers and the rate of annual increases over the life of the four-year contract. The union wants a $25 hourly minimum wage and increases of 7 percent in the first two years and 6.25 percent in the two years afterward, according to its latest public proposal.

Kaiser has countered with minimum hourly wages of between $21 and $23 next year, increasing by a dollar a year. Raises would vary among locations, with workers in some places, like Northern California, receiving annual increases of 4 percent for four years, while some others would receive an increase of 3.5 percent the first year, followed by 3 percent annual increases."
"Digging for Secrets From the Raccoon in Your Garbage
Scientists are studying urban animals and the diseases they carry, to understand the potential risks to people, pets and the animals themselves.

Early one morning last month, Laura Dudley Plimpton found herself in Forest Park, in Queens, staring at a pair of captured raccoons. It was not the first time that Ms. Plimpton, an ecologist at Columbia University, had caught two of them in a cage trap designed for one. But typically when that happened, she would find a mother and a small kit inside.

This trap contained two fully grown, rotund adults, two balls of bristly fur that had merged into what one member of the trapping team called a single “big squish.” The raccoons seemed to be unbothered, one resting casually atop the other inside the cage, which had jumbo marshmallows as bait.

“You guys are so silly,” Ms. Plimpton said. Her demeanor was improbably cheery, and her French braid was impressively neat for someone who had arrived at the park before dawn. “I really don’t know how they did that,” she added, turning toward a colleague. “They had to have raced each other to the marshmallow.”

For their trouble, the raccoons had earned themselves a quick veterinary exam, a rabies vaccine and a spot in Ms. Plimpton’s investigation: a study of urban animals, the pathogens they carry and how they might spread across the city.

Although rats receive most of the attention, New York City is crawling with all kinds of creatures — raccoons, skunks, opossums, deer and even the occasional coyote — that are not always visible to people. For these animals, urban living provides some clear opportunities, especially “if they learn to utilize human resources such as trash,” said Maria Diuk-Wasser, who leads Columbia’s eco-epidemiology lab, where Ms. Plimpton is a Ph.D. student.

But city life also poses distinct challenges for animals, which often live in close quarters and have frequent interactions with other species, including us. That can raise the risks of disease transmission to people, pets and wildlife.

So Ms. Plimpton, Dr. Diuk-Wasser and their colleagues are trying to learn more about these risks, in hopes of safeguarding both human and animal health. They are also shining a light on the way that our lives are intertwined with those of our animal neighbors, even in one of the most urban environments on Earth.

“We have all of these such close interactions with each other, whether we know it or not,” Ms. Plimpton said. “It’s always happening around us.”

Raccoon roundup
For years, Dr. Diuk-Wasser has been investigating how urban environments shape animal communities and how that, in turn, might affect the spread of certain pathogens. She has been especially interested in tick-borne diseases and exploring how landscape features on Staten Island affect the movements of deer, which drop ticks as they bound through the borough. “We have identified a strong correlation between deer visitation and finding ticks in someone’s yard,” Dr. Diuk-Wasser said.

The Covid pandemic provided an opportunity to expand the research, especially when it became clear that people were regularly passing SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid, to deer, cats and other animals. The universe of coronaviruses is vast, and Ms. Plimpton and Dr. Diuk-Wasser wondered whether there were other coronaviruses circulating in the city’s wildlife that might pose a risk to animals or people.

“As we started looking for coronaviruses, we started finding all of these other pathogens,” Ms. Plimpton said. “And seeing the burden that some of these populations have in terms of their health.”

Last summer, Ms. Plimpton was trapping and swabbing raccoons in Brooklyn’s sprawling Green-Wood Cemetery when she began noticing animals with strange symptoms: hair loss, scabbed paws, vision problems and disorientation. It was an outbreak of canine distemper, a disease that researchers had not been looking for at first. “It just happened in front of our eyes,” Dr. Diuk-Wasser said.

Canine distemper is not a health threat to humans, but it is often fatal in raccoons and skunks and can also affect dogs. And because it can be mistaken for rabies, outbreaks can be a drain on city resources, requiring officials to collect and test symptomatic raccoons.

The researchers soon confirmed the virus in 11 raccoons, two cats and one skunk. They hope that by sequencing the genomes of the viral samples they collected, they can untangle the chain of transmission and map how distemper spread through the cemetery.

That work is ongoing, but the raccoons’ movements, which Ms. Plimpton tracked with GPS collars and Bluetooth sensors, provided clues. The area around the southwestern corner of the cemetery was a hot spot for raccoon interactions. That region contained the cemetery’s service yard, where many employees work and eat, as well as some residential yards where locals were known to leave food out for stray cats.

Although the idea remains unproven, Ms. Plimpton hypothesizes that the area might have served as a “super-spreading zone,” with trash, gardens and cat food that attracted hungry raccoons and brought the animals into close contact.

The cemetery has already taken action, switching to trash cans that are harder for animals to climb into and encouraging those who live nearby not to leave cat food out at night, said Sara Evans, the senior manager and curator of living collections at Green-Wood. “Establishing healthier or more effective boundaries with the wildlife that inhabit the city, it really just takes the cooperation of literally everyone,” Ms. Evans said.

‘All the swabbing’
The researchers are also investigating these relationships at a larger, citywide scale, with a collection of biological specimens from about 700 animals, including raccoons, deer, opossums, skunks, cats, shrews and white-footed mice. “I’m starting to get carpal tunnel from all the swabbing,” Ms. Plimpton said.

On Sept. 14, she was back in action at Forest Park. Her colleagues at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, who were leading the trapping effort, had traversed the park the previous evening, placing traps in locations that seemed like promising raccoon territory. Large, old-growth oak trees often bring success. “It’s also pretty good to set near large areas of trash,” said Raven Schuman, a wildlife specialist at the U.S.D.A.

It was a good night of trapping, yielding 17 raccoons and four opossums. The next morning, the researchers began working through the animals one by one at their pop-up sampling site.

Ms. Schuman sedated the first raccoon. As soon as it conked out, the researchers got to work. “Once the animals go down, we have about 10 minutes,” said Ms. Plimpton, who swabbed the raccoon’s nose, mouth and rectum. Dr. Diuk-Wasser ran her fingers through the animal’s wiry hair, looking for ticks. Dr. Julian Rivera, a veterinarian at the Staten Island Zoo who was helping the researchers for the day, conducted a brief physical exam, drew blood and collected a few tiny tissue samples.

Then the next animal was up, and the three repeated their designated tasks. And so it went, for six nonstop hours. The animals varied widely in size, age and condition. “You are just a perfect specimen of a raccoon,” Ms. Plimpton cooed at one fluffy-eared kit, rubbing a gloved finger over its velvety paw. “This one is remarkably cute,” Dr. Rivera pronounced with veterinary expertise.

But an enormous adult, who had initially seemed robust, was not in great shape. He had ticks around his eyes and bald spots on his legs. Some of his teeth were missing and one paw appeared to be swollen. It was hard to know what ailed him, but his samples might provide a clue. His specimens, and all the others, would be sent to the researchers’ collaborators at Cornell and tested for coronaviruses, distemper and tick-borne pathogens.

So far, the scientists have not found any coronaviruses in raccoons, but they did isolate a novel coronavirus from a cat last summer. It was a type of coronavirus that had previously been associated with rabbits and rodents. Although it is not clear how the cat was infected, stray cats do sometimes feed on mice, and humans might unwittingly facilitate disease-spreading encounters; feeding stations for feral cats can also attract rodents, the researchers noted in a recent paper, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Now that the specimens have been collected, they can be used for a wide range of future projects. Ms. Plimpton dreams of using an approach known as metagenomics to identify all of the viruses the animals in the city are carrying. “The hardest part is always getting samples from wildlife populations,” she said. “It’s a privilege whenever you get to sample these animals.”

When Ms. Plimpton finally finished her swabbing in Forest Park, the animals were released where they had been found. The pair of raccoons that had stumbled into the same trap slept off their sedation in their own individual cages. When they came to, Ms. Schuman carried them into the woods, setting the traps down on a dirt path.

The first raccoon, a slightly smaller female, immediately dashed out and tore down the trail. The larger male slowly waddled out.

The physiology or medicine prize for Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman recognized work that led to the development of vaccines that were administered to billions around the world.

Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman, who together identified a chemical tweak to messenger RNA, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday. Their work enabled potent Covid vaccines to be made in less than a year, averting tens of millions of deaths and helping the world recover from the worst pandemic in a century.

The approach to mRNA the two researchers developed has been used in Covid shots that have since been administered billions of times globally and has transformed vaccine technology, laying the foundation for inoculations that may one day protect against a number of deadly diseases like cancer.

The slow and methodical research that made the Covid shots possible has now run up against a powerful anti-vaccine movement, especially in the United States. Skeptics have seized in part on the vaccines’ rapid development — among the most impressive feats of modern medical science — to undermine the public’s trust in them.

But the breakthroughs behind the shots unfolded little by little over decades, including at the University of Pennsylvania, where Dr. Weissman runs a lab.

Dr. Weissman said that he found out about the prize at 4 a.m. when Dr. Karikó texted him, asking if he had heard from Thomas yet. “No. Who’s Thomas?” he replied. Dr. Karikó told him that Thomas Perlmann was from the Nobel committee. He was looking for Dr. Weissman’s phone number.

Dr. Karikó, the 13th woman to win the prize, languished for many long years without funding or a permanent academic position, keeping her research afloat only by latching on to more senior scientists at the University of Pennsylvania who let her work with them. Unable to get a grant, she said she was told she was “not faculty quality” and was forced to retire from the university a decade ago. She remains only an adjunct professor there while she pursues plans to start a company with her daughter, Susan Francia, who has an M.B.A. and was a two-time Olympic gold medalist in rowing.

The mRNA work was especially frustrating, she said, because it was met with indifference and a lack of funds. She said she was motivated by more than not being called a quitter; as the work progressed, she saw small signs that her project could lead to better vaccines. “You don’t persevere and repeat and repeat just to say, ‘I am not giving up,’” she said.

She and Dr. Weissman had their first chance meeting over a copy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998.

Dr. Karikó, the daughter of a butcher, who had come to the United States from Hungary two decades earlier when her research program there ran out of money, was preoccupied by mRNA, which provides instructions to cells to make proteins. Defying the decades-old orthodoxy that mRNA was clinically unusable, she believed that it would spur medical innovations.

At the time, Dr. Weissman was desperate for new approaches to a vaccine against H.I.V., which had long proved impossible to defend against. A physician and virologist who had tried and failed for years to develop a treatment for AIDS, he wondered if he and Dr. Karikó could team up to make an H.I.V. vaccine.

It was a fringe idea that, when they began their research, seemed unlikely to work. The mRNA was delicate, so much so that when it was introduced to cells, the cells instantly destroyed it. Grant reviewers were not impressed. Dr. Weissman’s lab instead relied on seed money that the university gives new faculty members to get started.

“We saw the potential and we weren’t willing to give up,” Dr. Weissman said.

For years, Dr. Weissman and Dr. Karikó were flummoxed. Mice injected with mRNA became lethargic. Countless experiments failed. They wandered down one dead end after another. Their problem was that the immune system interprets mRNA as an invading pathogen and attacks it, sickening the animals while destroying the mRNA.

But eventually, the scientists discovered that cells protect their own mRNA with a specific chemical modification. So they tried making the same change to mRNA synthesized in the lab before injecting it into cells. It worked: The mRNA was taken up by cells without provoking an immune response.

The discovery “fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system,” the panel that awarded the prize said, adding that the work “contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times.”

At first, other scientists were largely uninterested in taking up that new approach to vaccination. Their paper, published in 2005, was rejected by the journals Nature and Science, Dr. Weissman said. The study was eventually accepted by a niche publication called Immunity.

But two biotech companies soon took notice: Moderna, in the United States, and BioNTech, in Germany, where Dr. Karikó eventually became a senior vice president. The companies studied the use of mRNA vaccines for flu, cytomegalovirus and other illnesses. None moved out of clinical trials for years.

Then the coronavirus emerged.

Almost instantly, Drs. Karikó and Weissman’s work came together with several strands of disparate research to put vaccine makers ahead of the game in developing shots. That included research done in Canada that allowed fragile mRNA molecules to be safely delivered to human cells, and studies in the United States that pointed the way toward stabilizing the spike protein that coronaviruses used to invade cells.

By late 2020, less than a year into a pandemic that would eventually kill at least seven million people globally, regulators had authorized strikingly effective vaccines made by Moderna and by BioNTech, which partnered with Pfizer to produce its vaccine. Both used the modification Dr. Karikó and Dr. Weissman discovered.

About 400 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 250 million doses of the Moderna vaccine have been administered in the United States. Hundreds of millions more have been given around the world. The use of mRNA has enabled both vaccines to be updated against new variants.

Dr. Karikó referred in an interview published by the University of Pennsylvania on Monday to her many years of clinging to the fringes of academia. In the interview, Dr. Karikó said that every October, her mother used to tell her, “I will listen to the radio that maybe you will get the Nobel Prize.” Dr. Karikó said she would answer: “Mum, you know, I never even get a grant.”

Dr. Karikó is the 13th woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine since 1901, and the first since 2015. Women represent a small fraction of the total of 227 people who have been awarded the prize, a reflection of how women are still largely underrepresented in the field of science and scientific awards, including the Nobel Prizes.

Vaccines using mRNA technology are now being developed against a number of diseases, including influenza, malaria and H.I.V., which remains difficult to inoculate against. Personalized cancer vaccines have also showed promise. They use mRNA tailored to an individual patient’s tumor to teach the person’s immune system to attack proteins on the tumor.

Drs. Karikó and Weissman’s discovery, scientists said, remained critical in allowing mRNA vaccines to escape destruction by patients’ immune systems and to trigger the efficient production of vaccine proteins.

“What is now recognized as a transformative technology required dedicated scientists to carry out fundamental research over many years to reach the position it was in 2020 when its rapid deployment as a vaccine technology was made possible by global collaboration,” Brian Ferguson, an immunologist at the University of Cambridge, said. “The work of Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman in the years prior to 2020 made this possible, and they richly deserve this recognition.”

Who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2022?
The prize went to Svante Pääbo, a Swedish scientist who produced a complete Neanderthal genome and helped create the field of ancient DNA studies.

When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced?
The prize for physiology or medicine is the first of six Nobel Prizes that will be awarded this year. Each award recognizes groundbreaking contributions by an individual or organization in a specific field.

The Nobel Prize in Physics will be awarded on Tuesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, John Clauser, Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger each won for independent works exploring quantum weirdness.

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be awarded on Wednesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, Carolyn R. Bertozzi, Morten Meldal and K. Barry Sharpless shared the prizes for work on “click chemistry.”

The Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded on Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. Last year, Annie Ernaux earned the prize for work that dissected the most humiliating, private and scandalous moments from her past with almost clinical precision.

The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo. Last year, the prize was shared by Memorial, a Russian organization; the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine; and Ales Bialiatski, a jailed Belarusian activist.

Next week, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences will be awarded on Monday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, Ben S. Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig shared the prize for work that helped to reshape how the world understands the relationship between banks and financial crises.

All of the prize announcements will be streamed live by the Nobel Prize organization.

"‘Close to the Line’: Why More Seniors Are Living in Poverty
Benefits extended earlier in the coronavirus pandemic have been rolled back. But many older Americans are not taking advantage of the aid still available.

It has never been easy for Mary Cole to support herself and the 19-year-old grandson who lives with her in Bristol, Va., on her monthly $914 Supplemental Security Income check.

But it’s getting harder. “I’ve been struggling a lot,” Ms. Cole said.

Because benefits counselors at her local agency on aging have helped her apply for several kinds of public assistance, she pays only $158 in rent for her apartment in a subsidized Section 8 building.

A federal program helps Ms. Cole, 69, with heating costs. The state underwrites her Medicare premiums, and a Medicare savings program allows her to fill prescriptions for heart disease, hypertension, pulmonary disease and diabetes.

But benefits that increased in the early years of the coronavirus pandemic have been rolled back since the federal government ended the public health emergency this year. Ms. Cole’s heating assistance dropped from $900 in 2021 to $600 last year.

Her benefits through SNAP — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps — had risen to $351 a month; they have since dropped to $140 a month. “That’s not going to feed us both,” she said. She has long since spent the federal stimulus checks mailed out in 2020 and 2021.

By the last week of the month, she often runs out of money and considers visiting a nearby food pantry. “I don’t like to do that,” Ms. Cole said. “I figure I’m taking something away from other people.”

Poverty among older Americans jumped sharply in 2022, the Census Bureau recently announced. Using the supplemental poverty measure, which economists have found is a more accurate reflection of income and spending than the official poverty rate, the proportion of people over age 65 living in poverty climbed from a modern low of 9.5 percent in 2020 to 10.7 percent in 2021.

Poverty in America
A Sharp Rise: The poverty rate soared in 2022 in the United States, particularly among children, as living costs rose and many federal pandemic aid programs ended.
Safety Net Barriers: Immigrant children, the fastest-growing group of American youths, have poverty rates more than twice those of other children. The hurdles their families face in getting aid aren’t helping.
A Persistent Problem: Over the past 50 years, there has been no real progress on how to address poverty in the United States. A sociologist offers a new explanation for an intractable problem.
Last year, the figure reached 14.1 percent, representing more than eight million older Americans.

“It’s quite alarming,” said Ramsey Alwin, president and chief executive of the National Council on Aging. “It’s really unacceptable.” Poverty among children also rose steeply, and median household income declined.

In southwestern Virginia, where the District Three Governmental Cooperative provides senior services and has helped more than 3,000 low-income residents like Ms. Cole apply for benefits this fiscal year, 20 percent of older residents live in poverty.

“We see it going up,” said Debbie Spencer, director of aging and disability services at the cooperative. She described clients “trying to decide if they’re going to eat or buy fuel or buy their medicines.”

How poor is poor? The supplemental measure defined poverty last year as an annual income below $15,998 for single adult renters ($22,624 for a two-adult household), with regional variations; the threshold was somewhat lower for homeowners, regardless of whether they had mortgages.

Black, Hispanic and Indigenous older Americans have higher poverty rates; so do women and those who aren’t married.

The Elder Index, devised by gerontologists at the University of Massachusetts Boston, also calculates how much money older adults need to meet their basic needs. In metropolitan Chicago, for example, a single renter over age 65 in good health required $2,481 per month last year for housing, health care, food, transportation and other expenses, according to the calculator.

The same renter in Bristol, Va. — Ms. Cole’s hometown — needed $1,794. Nationally, the average Social Security retirement benefit last year came to $1,792 monthly.

“Poverty rates fell in the early years of the pandemic because of the stimulus payments many older adults received,” along with raises in other benefits, said Richard Johnson, an economist at the Urban Institute.

As those payments and benefit increases ended, inflation took off, eroding buying power before it began declining.

“Social Security has cost-of-living increases, but they come with a lag,” Dr. Johnson said. Monthly inflation peaked in June 2022, but the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits, a hefty 8.7 percent increase, didn’t factor into beneficiaries’ checks until January.

“A lot of seniors live close to the line, so it doesn’t take much to tip them over” into poverty, said Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at the New School for Social Research. Her studies also show the pandemic’s effect on older workers’ employment; so many retired early or were pushed out that about a million fewer older adults are now in the work force.

Even if senior poverty rates were to stabilize or decline next year, eased by the higher benefits some states provide, the figures generally remain stubbornly high compared to those in other industrialized nations with stronger public safety nets.

The proportion of older Americans living below the official poverty level fell drastically through the 1960s and 1970s, largely because of expansions and increases in Social Security. But there has since been a plateau.

“It’s not fully appreciated how persistent senior poverty has been,” Dr. Johnson said. “The decline really slowed in the 1990s and hasn’t improved significantly since.”

Economists and advocates have suggested solutions: raising the minimum Social Security benefit; increasing Social Security payments after people reach age 85, when health care costs typically increase; and improving S.S.I. benefits for older adults and people with disabilities who lack the work history to qualify for Social Security. Those steps would require congressional action.

For now, though, enrolling more older people in existing programs could have real impact. Federal benefits go a long way toward reducing poverty. Social Security alone lifted 20 million people over age 65 above the poverty level last year, according to census data. SNAP, housing subsidies and S.S.I. prevented another 1.6 million seniors from sinking into poverty.

But only about half of the older people eligible for food stamps have enrolled, meaning five million are missing out, Ms. Alwin said. Considering all public programs, “about $30 billion is left on the table every year that could help with food and medicine and other basic needs,” she said. “It’s eye-popping.”

Though most older people recognize that they qualify for Social Security, they’re often less aware of energy and housing assistance, Medicaid and Medicare programs for low-income beneficiaries, state property tax rebates or food stamps. “They may think they’re not for them but for someone else who’s more in need,” Ms. Alwin said.

Moreover, applying for these programs can be complicated and time-consuming; some require digital access and skills. Some applicants just give up.

“We err on the side of making sure that not one person gets benefits they’re not entitled to, and we sacrifice a lot of people who are eligible,” Dr. Ghilarducci said.

The National Council on Aging’s online Benefits Checkup tool shows which public and private programs seniors qualify for; the council also operates a toll-free help line (1-800-794-6559) staffed by benefits experts. With federal and foundation funding, it supports 84 benefit enrollment centers through local aging and family service agencies, senior centers and United Way programs.

Though such benefits counselors helped Ms. Cole receive assistance with housing, heating and food, she still doesn’t feel secure, and she relies on another source of support.

“God will take care of me,” she said. “I have faith that he will take care of my needs.”

"For Black Mothers, Birthing Centers, Once a Refuge, Become a Battleground
Some say the facilities, which focus on autonomy in childbirth, could lead to better health outcomes — but officials are tightening rules, citing risk.

Gabrielle Glaze felt scolded and shamed when she delivered her first son in a Birmingham, Ala., hospital, forced to observe strict rules about lying stationary through her contractions and enduring countless cervical checks from “total strangers” who seemed disappointed by her body’s progress.

So when Ms. Glaze, 33, gave birth to a second son in a birthing center in April, surrounded by a team of midwives who said they would let her body lead the way, it seemed as if her previous labor experience had finally been redeemed.

Ms. Glaze found herself telling every woman she knew about Oasis Family Birthing Center in Birmingham, which was run by an obstetrician and midwives — many of them Black, like her — and encouraged patients through an unhurried, uninterrupted, natural labor process. She said it seemed like the answer to centuries of birthing trauma among Black women, providing medical expertise in a culturally familiar space, with the hope of improving both birthing experiences and health outcomes for women of color.

But Ms. Glaze was one of the last women to deliver at the facility. In June, the Alabama Department of Public Health shut it down, despite its record of smooth deliveries with no complications. State regulators are now weeks away from instituting new birth center licensing rules that would make it nearly impossible for similar facilities to open and operate.

“If these rules are not implemented, there will be fewer safeguards and standards for the operation of these facilities, exposing mothers and their newborns to increased risks to their health and safety,” a public draft of the new policy says.

Oasis and two other birth centers seeking to operate have sued the state with the help of the A.C.L.U., seeking to overturn the closure and create a path for others to open. A trial to determine their fate began on Thursday. On Saturday, a judge issued a preliminary injunction that prohibits the state from refusing to license birth centers that meet national standards while the court case plays out.

In a state like Alabama, which has the third-highest maternal death rate and the sixth-highest infant death rate in the United States, some public health experts see birth centers as a potential solution to a gut-wrenching problem: Almost two-thirds of counties in Alabama have little to no local maternity care options. Next month, two labor and delivery units in the Birmingham area are set to close, including the last remaining unit in one of Alabama’s largest counties. Black mothers and infants make up a disproportionate share of bad health outcomes.

Research is limited, but free-standing birth centers, which take only low-risk patients, are associated with lower rates of preterm delivery, higher birth weights, lower rates of cesarean sections, increased breastfeeding rates and about $2,000 in Medicaid savings per patient, compared with traditional care, according to a multiyear study conducted by the federal government.

Across the United States, which has the highest maternal mortality rate in the industrialized world, receptivity toward birth centers varies. Some states, including Minnesota and Florida, have embraced the facilities so long as they meet national standards and the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers recognizes them. Texas has at least 80 free-standing birth centers, run primarily by licensed midwives.

But in other states, including Mississippi and Kentucky, birthing centers face a battle similar to the one in Alabama. Officials in Georgia recently denied approval for a birth center in Augusta despite broad public support, because local hospitals refused to sign patient transfer agreements.

A spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Public Health declined to comment on either the shutdown of Oasis or the state’s new birthing center regulations, citing continuing litigation.

Dr. Heather Skanes, the obstetrician and gynecologist who ran Oasis, said the department notified her in a phone call that the facility needed a hospital license to operate, but when she asked for a path to licensure, the department declined to provide one. The lawsuit against the department argues that this is an unlawful “de facto ban.”

The new regulations, set to take effect Oct. 15, require a physician to be on call to commute into the facility in case of an emergency, a delay that midwives say would endanger a patient in need of a speedy transfer to higher-level care. The birth center will also be required to have a written transfer agreement with a hospital — a document the midwives say is unnecessary, since federal law requires hospitals to accept women in active labor.

Birthing centers must also be within a 30-minute drive of a hospital with obstetricians on staff. About 28 percent of women in Alabama have no birthing hospital within 30 minutes.

“The rules are designed to provide for the health and safety of mothers in the prenatal, delivery and postnatal stages of the childbirth experience, as well as the health and safety of their newborns,” the draft of the new policy states.

Kate Bauer, the executive director of the American Association of Birth Centers, which sets national standards for the facilities, said the new rules in Alabama were “out of touch with the evidence for well-functioning birth centers.”

Supporters of birth centers, where deliveries more than doubled from 2004 to 2017 and continued to rise during the Covid pandemic, said they believed officials were blocking the centers because of longstanding conflicts of interest with the state’s medical establishment. Birth center deliveries, which often cost around $6,000, could be considered competition for hospitals, where delivering a baby can bring in more than $20,000.

“You would think that Alabama would be tired of being at the bottom of the barrel with maternal health outcomes and disparities, and wouldn’t actively stand in the way of us fixing them,” said Stephanie Mitchell, a midwife who is planning to open a rural birthing facility in western Alabama in the coming months. She has joined the lawsuit against the state’s health department.

Birth centers aren’t necessarily for everyone, said Katy Kozhimannil, the director of the Rural Health Research Center at the University of Minnesota, who studies health equity in childbirth. But they are a lifeline for communities with barriers to good maternity care — whether those barriers are geographic, financial or cultural.

Dr. Skanes, who opened Oasis in June 2022, said she vetted applicants using national criteria to ensure their deliveries would be low risk. She equipped the facility with emergency supplies for hemorrhages, resuscitations and patient transfers, just in case. (She ultimately never used them.)

It was a particularly appealing option for Black women, who made up a large majority of the center’s patients and who are, research has found, significantly more likely to report mistreatment during childbirth, such as being ignored, shouted at or denied care.

Jakiera Lucy, 30, learned about Oasis through Chocolate Milk Mommies, a support group for Black mothers seeking to breastfeed. Her birth plan had been largely ignored when she delivered her first child in a hospital, she said — she still gets shivers down her spine when someone mentions the facility — and when the birth of her second child came around, she was still paying for the first.

At Oasis, Ms. Lucy’s husband, Jay, learned how to release the tension in her hips during contractions and support her labor on a yoga ball. Ms. Lucy delivered in a teal pool, surrounded by glowing string lights and a team of midwives in T-shirts and sneakers. Photographs from the moment after the birth show her leaning back in the tub, baby on her chest, beaming.

“This is back to our roots — back to what our grandmothers did — before we were forced into hospitals that hand out pamphlets where the white women have husbands and the Black women are always alone,” Ms. Lucy said.

The state’s decision to shut down the birth center is particularly devastating, she said, because it is a deciding factor for her and her husband on whether they will have another child. “It’s like a carrot was dangling, and then it got snatched away.”

For Ms. Mitchell, the midwife aiming to open the rural birthing center in western Alabama, the staffing and distance requirements of the new rules are disqualifying. The tiny town of Gainesville (population: 174), in the heart of Alabama’s Black Belt, originally named for its rich, dark soil, is 37 miles from the nearest hospital labor and delivery ward, with no other midwives listed in the county.

“They’re putting me in an ethical dilemma, where I’m going to have to pick between offering a service that saves lives and actually following the law,” she said. “So I guess they’ll have to haul me off to jail.”

She worked for years to raise money to purchase a two-story antebellum house near a bandstand that local lore says was used to sell enslaved people, and renovate it into a full-service birthing center called Birth Sanctuary. She plans to open in January.

On a recent afternoon, Ms. Mitchell, who has a doctoral degree in nursing, walked through Birth Sanctuary to the echoes of cicadas, to check the progress of the new floor plan, complete with a hydrotherapy room and a full kitchen to keep the laboring women nourished. Outside, she sat beneath a weeping willow, considering how the fate of her vision was now in question.

Ms. Mitchell quickly learned of Alabama’s longstanding aversion to midwifery when she moved to Gainesville from Boston in 2020. The state outlawed the practice in the 1970s, and several midwives who attended out-of-hospital births were charged with crimes. Midwives could not legally assist women in giving birth outside of hospitals in the state until 2017.

She believes the new rule is no coincidence, given the deep ties that have long existed between the state’s public health officials and the traditional medical establishment. Even today, the state health officer — appointed in most states by the governor or a governor’s board — is still appointed largely by representatives from the state’s medical association.

Several members of Alabama Department of Public Health’s Licensure Advisory Board, which approved the text of the new regulations, are directly appointed by the state’s medical association, which represents doctors, or its hospital association. Twelve of the 16 board members on the public health committee — which voted to move forward with the regulations despite a public hearing with more than 70 unanimous objections — are appointed by the medical association.

And six members of the legislative council, the group of Alabama lawmakers that holds the power to stop the regulations from taking effect, received financial contributions from the state’s medical political action committee during the 2022 election cycle.

Mark Jackson, the executive director of the medical association, said the group did not submit comments or participate in the drafting of the new regulations, but that “the top concern of physicians is the health and well-being of patients. Consequently, we want all health services provided outside of a hospital setting to be as risk-averse as possible.”

The officials who shepherded the regulations through included a veterinarian, dentist, psychiatrist, urologist and at least four hospital chief executives — but no midwives.

“If this was really about safety, there would be some effort to involve those of us who actually do this work,” Dr. Skanes said.

At Oasis, the lights are still out, but Karneshia Jemison, 32, still comes by to see Dr. Skanes in the room where she had planned to deliver her baby next month.  The shelves are fully stocked — expired medicines routinely replaced with fresh ones, just in case."
"A Third of Medicaid Recipients With Opioid Use Disorder Aren’t Getting Medication to Treat It
A new analysis also found wide disparities in age and race, with Black and young people receiving treatments at far lower rates than white and middle-aged people.

More than half a million Medicaid recipients diagnosed with opioid use disorder did not receive medication to treat it in 2021, according to a new report released Friday by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services.

The report, which examined the use of addiction treatments that almost all Medicaid programs are now required to cover, also found major disparities in medication rates across states, ages and racial groups. It said the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, an agency of the Health and Human Services Department, should work to close the gaps.

“Medicaid is uniquely positioned to achieve these goals given that the program is estimated to cover almost 40 percent of nonelderly adults with opioid use disorder,” the report said.

The half-million people who did not receive treatment amounted to about one-third of all Medicaid recipients with opioid use disorder. The authors of the report expressed concern that, when a five-year mandatory coverage period issued by the federal government ends in September 2025, some states could again start restricting access.

Dr. Bradley Stein, the director of the RAND Opioid Policy Center and a senior physician policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, who was not involved in the report, said he had expected even lower overall treatment rates. Still, he said, for certain groups, “things are not where they need to be, and I’m asking: Are the successes things we’re going to be able to sustain or not?”

More than 80,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2021 — about 17 percent more than the prior year. Research shows that medications including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone are effective in blunting cravings, and can help prevent deaths.

But people seeking medication treatment often struggle to find providers willing to prescribe the medications — and they often face stigma surrounding their use. Some patients might also be unaware that they can obtain treatment under Medicaid, since state Medicaid programs were not required to cover the treatments until October 2020.

Investigators used enrollment, eligibility and claim data  to understand the extent to which people with opioid use disorder received medication.

The rate of medication uptake varied widely across states, from less than 40 percent of Medicaid patients with the disorder in Illinois and Mississippi to almost 90 percent in Rhode Island and Vermont. Medicaid expansion in some states most likely plays a role, said Dr. Stein, as well as “tremendous variation” in state policies around the provision of medication, such as reimbursement for telehealth expenses and the ability of nurse practitioners and physician assistants to independently prescribe.

In 10 states, including New York and Texas, more than half of Medicaid enrollees with opioid use disorder did not receive any medication — enough people to account for a quarter of all Medicaid patients with the disorder across the country.

Only 15 states kept comprehensive data on participants’ race and ethnicity. But among them, officials found that more than 70 percent of white patients with opioid use disorder received medication, compared to about 53 percent of Black patients — a worrisome inequity, they said, considering that overdose deaths have increased more dramatically among Black people.

The young and the old are also at a disadvantage: For Medicaid enrollees under age 19, only about 11 percent of those with the disorder received medication treatment, compared with 70 percent among those 19 to 44. (Research has shown that pediatric treatment programs that involve medication are sparse.) Less than half of Medicaid patients 65 and older with the disorder used the treatment.

The inspector general’s office outlined specific steps for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to take to encourage states to reduce barriers and reach marginalized groups, including creating a social media campaign and fact sheets to disseminate information.

For Dr. Ayana Jordan, an associate professor of psychiatry at N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine, who studies race and addiction, the recommendations were “infuriating” because they failed to include policy moves, like giving incentives to health care providers to work in settings that have few prescribers, partnering with churches and other community organizations, or dealing with medication shortages in pharmacies that serve communities of color.

“They ‘encourage, encourage, encourage’ action — what does that mean? Nothing. It is not enough,” she said. “How can the federal government be involved in actually holding states accountable?”

Dr. Jordan, who treats mostly Medicaid patients in marginalized groups, said she “is tired of seeing so many of them die.”

“I’m over it,” she said. “There is intense sorrow in trying to address a crisis when you are very much handicapped by a lack of legislation.”"
"F.D.A. Moves to Regulate Lab Tests That It Says Put Patients ‘at Risk’
Genetic testing that reveals potential cancer risks or other maladies with no regulatory oversight is among the targets of the agency’s proposed review.

The Food and Drug Administration said on Friday that it was moving to close what has widely been viewed as a loophole allowing certain lab tests — like those that determine the profile of a tumor or the genetic health of a fetus — to bypass review with virtually no tracking or oversight.

The agency proposed a rule that would bring the tests under its regulatory authority, requiring laboratories conducting them to provide data on test accuracy. Hundreds of tests on the market have very little oversight and may be misleading to the public and patients seeking to learn whether they have Lyme disease, Alzheimer’s or will develop cancer.

The proliferation of these tests “leaves Americans vulnerable to making important health care choices based on potentially faulty or inaccurate test results,” Dr. Robert Califf, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a news briefing on Friday.

The tests, which included the first ones to detect Covid-19, have been subject to agency concern for 30 years and have been a perennial — yet essentially untouchable — target by lawmakers dating back to former Senators Edward Kennedy and Barack Obama and as recently as this year.

Academic medical centers that include labs operating the tests have opposed changes, citing the importance of being nimble in the face of a rapidly changing, pandemic-prone world.

Though renewed attention about the tests’ accuracy may be unsettling to patients, there have been few clues available to them — or even to their doctors — about whether the tests were vetted or received thorough F.D.A. oversight, according to Jeff Allen, president of the Friends of Cancer Research, a nonprofit partly funded by pharmaceutical companies.

“A rule like this is getting to it at the front end to be sure each test out there meets reliable accuracy standards — so those questions don’t need to be asked,” he said.

Mr. Allen said the pathology lab in a hospital may know the origins of a test, but that information is rarely passed on to doctors and patients. He said that his organization was concerned about the accuracy of tests administered to glean the genetic profile of a tumor that led to decisions on treatment.

An investigation by The New York Times found that prenatal genetic screening tests were frequently wrong, with many false-positive results.

Academic researchers, physicians and the F.D.A. have criticized other, similar tests, as well. Those include tests that are meant to calculate a person’s so-called genetic propensity for developing diabetes or becoming an elite athlete.

Doctors have also raised concerns about tests meant to predict the chances of developing Alzheimer’s disease. In 2015, the F.D.A. issued a report about 20 tests of concern, including one to detect ovarian cancer and another for Lyme disease. A longstanding concern about the tests is whether they have misled patients facing decisions about aborting a fetus with a possible genetic abnormality or getting a mastectomy or hysterectomy based on cancer screenings.

Opponents of additional F.D.A. oversight say the agency does not have the resources to review and oversee tests for emerging health concerns.

Susan Van Meter, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, which represents lab companies and test makers, said in a statement that billions of tests were run each year that influence a majority of the decisions made by health providers.

The association noted that the only test now available to detect fentanyl mixed with a dangerous animal tranquilizer, xylazine — a combination known as “tranq dope” — is one that would be subject to the new layer of oversight.

“F.D.A. seriously risks falling behind on its current public health priorities,” according to the association’s statement released on Friday. The association said it planned to ask the agency to withdraw the proposed rule and said it would continue to work with Congress on the matter.

An effort to update oversight of lab tests failed late last year in Congress after advocacy groups spent countless hours on a compromise. Called the Valid Act, the measure was expected to pass in an omnibus budget bill, but ultimately was not included. It was reintroduced earlier this year.

The regulatory paths for lab tests generally depend on who is analyzing the test. Tests manufactured by a company and performed by a consumer or health care provider tend to be regulated by the F.D.A., which requires the test maker to evaluate and report on its accuracy.

The less regulated tests, known as “lab-developed” tests, tend to be processed at a central location with results transmitted back to consumers or health care providers. Those tests may be overseen by lab experts for Medicare and may also be accredited by the College of American Pathologists.

The F.D.A. is not even sure how many lab-developed tests exist.

“No one truly knows how many of these tests are out there, or who makes which one, let alone which tests have a track record of inadequate results and problems and which don’t,” said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, the head of the F.D.A.’s medical device and diagnostics division, during the briefing on Friday.

The proposed rule will be open for public comment and likely will be challenged in court, said Jeffrey Shapiro, a lawyer at King & Spalding who represents some labs that have developed tests.

He said the lab-developed tests are services or procedures that are already regulated by Medicare officials.

“This proposed rule is nothing new, it’s the same dispute that F.D.A. has been having with industry for 30 years,” Mr. Shapiro said. “Major economic questions like this one affecting the health of millions should be decided by Congress, not F.D.A.”

The agency also noted how long the debate over these unregulated tests has dragged on, with Dr. Califf acknowledging on Friday that the agency had to deal with how prolific the tests had become.

“Laboratory-developed tests play a central role in U.S. health care, and many are similar to other tests that come in to the F.D.A. for review,” Dr. Califf said. “This approach no longer makes sense and puts U.S. patients at risk.”

"Peace Corps Sued Over Mental Health Policy
Applicants have challenged the Peace Corps practice of rescinding invitations to applicants on the basis of mental health conditions.

Lea Iodice was thrilled to hear that the Peace Corps had accepted her application and was sending her to Senegal as a community health care worker. She shared the good news with her roommates, her family and her favorite professor and daydreamed about her last day at her job, managing a gym called SnapFitness.

She was crushed, about a month later, to receive a letter from the Peace Corps Office of Medical Services saying that her offer was being rescinded because she was in treatment for anxiety. Though she had been in therapy to manage occasional panic attacks, she had never taken any psychiatric medication, been hospitalized or engaged in any kind of self-harm.

“The reason for medical nonclearance is that you are currently diagnosed with an unspecified anxiety disorder,” read the letter, which appeared in her online application portal. “You indicated that your anxiety symptoms of increased heart rate and queasiness recur during periods of stress, which is likely to occur during service.”

Searching online, Ms. Iodice discovered that her experience was not uncommon. For years, comparing notes under anonymous screen names, Peace Corps applicants have shared stories about being disqualified because of mental health history, including common disorders like depression and anxiety.

The practice is the subject of a lawsuit filed this week in federal court, accusing the Peace Corps of discriminating against applicants with disabilities in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination in programs receiving federal funds.

The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, includes accounts from nine people whose Peace Corps invitations were rescinded for mental health reasons. The suit alleges that those decisions were made without considering reasonable accommodations or making individualized assessments based on current medical knowledge.

In a statement, a Peace Corps official said he could not comment on pending litigation, but added that “the health, safety and security of Volunteers are the Peace Corps’s top priority.”

“The agency has a statutory responsibility to provide necessary and appropriate medical care for Volunteers during service,” said Jim Golden, acting associate director of the Office of Health Services, in a statement. “Many health conditions — including mental health care — that are easily managed in the U.S. may not be able to be addressed in the areas where Peace Corps Volunteers are assigned.”

He said each candidate’s medical history is assessed individually to determine whether the agency can support the individual’s needs.  

The three plaintiffs in the lawsuit are not identified by name in the court filings. But other Peace Corps applicants described rescinded offers as a major blow at a vulnerable time in their lives, throwing post-college plans into doubt and forcing them to explain to family, friends and supporters that they had been rejected because of a mental health condition.

“It was really heartbreaking to be dismissed like that,” said Ms. Iodice, now 26, who is not a party to the lawsuit. “It took a lot of processing to get over the initial feeling of unworthiness.”

The Peace Corps medically screens accepted applicants before sending them overseas to ensure that they do not face health crises when they are in locations where specialized care may not be available. Similar screenings are used in the State Department and the military.

But those policies are coming under pressure from legal activists. Early this year, the State Department agreed to pay $37.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit, filed 16 years ago, challenging a hiring requirement that an applicant should be able to work in any State Department overseas post without the need for ongoing medical treatment.

In recent years, the Peace Corps has deployed around 7,000 volunteers to more than 60 nations, according to recent figures from the Congressional Research Service. A review of the medical clearance system found that, in 2006, around 450 applicants were medically disqualified from serving.

“I was shocked, at first, at how broad and antiquated some of these policies seem,” said Megan Schuller, legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, which, along with Bryan Schwartz Law, is representing the plaintiffs.

One party to the lawsuit filed on Tuesday, Teresa, 22, who asked to be identified by her middle name out of concern that stigma would damage her employment prospects, had been accepted this past January for a volunteer position in Mexico working on climate change awareness.

In March, before her planned departure, she was told that she had failed her medical clearance because of her history of treatment for anxiety and depression. She appealed the decision but was denied.

Like many undergraduates, she had struggled during the isolation of the pandemic and attended therapy and took an antidepressant medication in 2020, never considering that these treatments might disqualify her from serving in the Peace Corps, she said.

“There was part of me that thought, This can’t happen,” she said. “I do not know a single person throughout my whole college experience who didn’t struggle with their mental health.”

The letter informing her of her nonclearance cited “active symptoms of anxiety, increased heart rate, inability to sit still, inability to say no,” all symptoms noted down by her therapist in 2021, she said. She spent the weeks around college graduation explaining, again and again, that she wouldn’t be going to Mexico after all.

“It’s really humiliating to tell people that you got in and were then rejected because of your mental health,” said Teresa, who is now training to be a paralegal.

Another party to the case, Anne, 34, who also asked to be identified by her middle name out of concern for stigma, was offered a Peace Corps position in Mongolia teaching at the university level.

On her medical clearance forms, she shared that she had made two suicide attempts at age 15, she said in an interview. Since then, however, she had lived abroad as an exchange student and worked for more than a decade as a public school English teacher with no recurrence of suicidal behavior.

Her rejection letter, which arrived in November, said that she was assessed as a high risk for a recurrence of suicidal behavior. She scrambled to appeal the decision but was denied.

“When you get a denial based on something from half your life ago, it feels like a punishment for being honest, and it feels like part of your past that you can’t escape,” said Anne, who teaches at a high school. “I was very upset. I was confused and trying to figure out how to do it — to save this dream.”

Complaints over the policy have simmered for years in online forums and were the subject of a Change.org petition in 2019 and coverage this year in Worldview magazine, a news site for the National Peace Corps Association.

Applicants are increasingly forthcoming in discussing their experiences with medical clearance, said Jade Fletcher-Getzlaff, 33, who outlined her own denial and successful appeal in a YouTube video in 2019.

With each wave of deployments, she said, she receives between five and 10 inquiries from applicants who have been disqualified because of mental health conditions.

“As more people are seeking therapy, and more openly talking about these issues, I think it may be coming up more often,” she said in an interview from Japan, where she now teaches, after serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Cambodia.

Rates of anxiety and depression among young U.S. adults have risen sharply in recent years.

In 2020, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that 63 percent of adults aged 18 to 24 years reported mental health symptoms, compared with 31 percent of all adults. Young adults also expressed greater need for mental health treatment, with 41 percent of adults aged 19 to 25 reporting unmet needs, compared with 26 percent of all adults.

Kirstine Schatz, 24, who is currently serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco, said she was initially denied a medical clearance because she took sertraline, a common antidepressant, for six months on the recommendation of her primary care physician.

She discontinued the medication seven months before applying and never received any mental health diagnosis, she said, but she was informed that she was denied medical clearance because the stressful environment of the Peace Corps might trigger a relapse.  

Ms. Schatz appealed the decision, emphasizing that she had been off the medication and stable for six months, and the decision was overturned. She urged the agency to change its screening policy.  “They are missing out on so many amazing people because of this archaic mind-set they have on mental health,” she said. “It’s 2023. They need to figure it out.”

As for Ms. Iodice, she never appealed her initial rejection and is still at SnapFitness, where she is the general manager. She said she had no regrets about receiving therapy, even though it might have kept her from serving with the Peace Corps in Senegal.

“If I had applied before I went to therapy, I could have gotten there, but I would have been a way worse worker, in my opinion,” she said. “In my perspective, I am a stronger person. I know myself better. I know how to cope.”"
"As Covid Infections Rise, Nursing Homes Are Still Waiting for Vaccines
Now that the U.S. government has stepped back from issuing vaccines, long-term care operators have yet to start administering shots to protect one of the most vulnerable populations.

“Covid is not pretty in a nursing home,” said Deb Wityk, a 70-year-old retired massage therapist who lives in one called Spurgeon Manor, in rural Iowa. She has contracted the disease twice, and is eager to get the newly approved vaccine because she has chronic leukemia, which weakens her immune system.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved the latest vaccine two weeks ago, and the new shots became available to the general public within the last week or so. But many nursing homes will not begin inoculations until well into October or even November, though infections among this vulnerable population are rising, to nearly 1 percent, or 9.7 per 1,000 residents, as of mid-September, from a low of 2.2 per 1,000 residents in mid-June.

“The distribution of the new Covid-19 vaccine is not going well,” said Chad Worz, the chief executive of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists. “Older adults in those settings are certainly the most vulnerable and should have been prioritized.”

With the end of the formal public health emergency in May, the federal government stopped purchasing and distributing Covid vaccines. That has added new complications for operators of nursing homes, who have encountered resistance throughout the pandemic in persuading people, especially employees, to receive yet another round of shots.

The coronavirus decimated nursing homes during the first two years of the pandemic, killing more than 200,000 residents and staff members. Elizabeth Sobczyk, the project director of Moving Needles, a C.D.C.-funded initiative to improve adult immunization rates in long-term care facilities, said that without a government agreement to purchase the shots, vaccine manufacturers would only make large quantities once C.D.C. experts recommended approval.

“Then they need to be F.D.A. inspected — we want safe vaccines — then there is contracting and roll out,” Ms. Sobczyk said. “So I completely understand the frustration, but also why the availability wasn’t immediate.”

Even once the shots are available, nursing homes face continuing resistance to the vaccines among nurses and aides. Without state mandates for workers to be vaccinated, most nursing homes are relying on persuasion, and that is often proving difficult.

“People want Covid-19 to be in the rearview mirror,” said Leslie Eber, medical director of Orchard Park Health Care Center in Centennial, Colo. “We’re going to have to remind people more this year that Covid-19 is not benign. Maybe it’s a cold for some people, but it’s not going to be a cold for the folks I care for.”

Only 62 percent of nursing home residents are up-to-date on their vaccines, meaning they have received the last booster available before this month’s new shot, according to federal data from mid-September. That’s an improvement over the 38 percent rate at the start of October 2022.

But only 25 percent of nursing home employees are up-to-date, which is close to last October’s rate.

More on Covid-19
N95 Companies: Project N95 and Mask-C, two face mask providers, said they were closing, a sign of the slow and steady decline of what was once a much-sought-after item.
Omicron: In the two years since its emergence, the dominant variant of the coronavirus has proved to be not only staggeringly infectious, but an evolutionary marvel, challenging many assumptions virologists had before the pandemic.
Long Covid: As more young Americans report serious cognitive problems, scientists suggest that the increase captures the effects of long Covid, most likely in addition to other effects of the pandemic, including psychological distress.
Stroke Risk: The Covid vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may be linked to a slight increase in the risk of stroke when administered along with a high-dose flu vaccine that is usually given to older people, according to a new analysis by the F.D.A.
In a written statement, the Department of Health and Human Services said that it would be identifying long-term care facilities with low vaccination rates and reaching out to ensure “proven infection prevention and control measures are being implemented to protect seniors.”

This year, more nurses and aides will have to obtain shots at drugstores or health centers on their personal time, rather than at work. Many homes are running clinics, with their long-term care pharmacies supplying the vaccine as they did before, but they face extra bureaucratic hassles in billing insurers for the vaccine for both residents and employees.

On top of that, homes are rolling out a new vaccine for a dangerous respiratory virus, R.S.V., which will be a third shot for many residents, along with vaccines for Covid and the flu.

The trio of vaccines will create more administrative complexity for nursing homes because now they must bill Medicare to be reimbursed for the shots. The Covid vaccine is charged to Medicare Part B, which covers outpatient and physicians’ services, but the R.S.V. vaccine must be billed to Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit.

“The United States has been phenomenal in screwing up vaccinations,” said David Nace, chief medical officer of UPMC Senior Communities in Pittsburgh. “This idea that some are under Part B and some are under Part D and some can be billed by a pharmacy — who in God’s name came up with this?”

While Medicare will pay for vaccines for most nursing home residents, employees may face private insurance red tape and, for a small group, potential out-of-pocket costs.

Leslie Frane, an executive vice president of Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 134,000 workers in 1,465 nursing homes, said that many homes had stopped running clinics in their facilities and had told workers to go to the drugstore to get vaccinated. She said this would lead to more workers skipping their shots.

“There’s very little time, given how many nursing home workers work multiple jobs,” she said.

The C.D.C. has arranged for 25 to 30 million people who lack health insurance or whose insurance doesn’t cover the complete cost of the vaccine to get free Covid shots at select pharmacies, health centers and medical offices listed on www.vaccines.gov. Ms. Frane said the program was not well-known among workers, and Mr. Worz said distribution was favoring the large pharmacy chains, slowing access in rural communities. Of the nation’s 19,400 independent pharmacies, federal officials said 627, many in rural areas, were enrolled in the program and 100 more were being added.

A big obstacle, though, continues to be resistance to vaccination among nurses and aides. Like many facility owners, Avalon Health Care Group, which owns or operates more than a dozen nursing homes in western states, is not mandating staff be vaccinated. Dr. Sabine von Preyss-Friedman, Avalon’s chief medical officer, says she tries to address the reasons with each worker and won’t abandon the push.

“We’re not going to just say, ‘OK, everyone get vaccinated,’ and then forget about it,” she said.

Avalon’s homes have used modest financial incentives to encourage staff members to get vaccinated. Some have organized contests between different units, with the winner getting prizes like a pizza party or a drawing for a gift certificate from a department store, and those efforts will resume this year.

Jim Wright, the medical director of Our Lady of Hope Health Center and two other nursing homes in Richmond, Va., said that rewards and respectful persuasion were not enough to sway his homes’ employees. They tend to be in their 20s and 30s, he said, and are not worried about catching Covid, which many have already weathered.

“They most likely will not do it to protect the residents or protect themselves,” he said. “I don’t know what the answer is.”

Sheena Bumpas, a nursing assistant in Duncan, Okla., and vice chair of the National Association of Health Care Assistants, planned to get this season’s shot, but said some of her colleagues would not.

“Now that the public health emergency has ended, I think people are done with it,” she said.

Edenwald Senior Living, a nursing home within a retirement community in Towson, Md., is requiring its workers be vaccinated unless they can justify an exemption for medical or religious reasons.

As of Sept. 10, about three-fourths of the home’s workers were up-to-date with their previous Covid vaccines, triple the national rate for nursing home employees, according to federal records.

Edenwald is relying on the Giant supermarket pharmacy to administer the shots in the auditorium of its independent living section. Sign-up sheets have already been distributed for clinics later this month. The home is billing workers’ insurance for the shots, but managers at the home said it would pay for employees without health coverage.

“This is our seventh clinic for Covid,” said Meghan Curtis, Edenwald’s director of care management. “We’ve kind of got it down pat.”

Swati Gaur, the medical director of three nursing homes affiliated with Northeast Georgia Health System, said some homes might offer recalcitrant employees the Novavax vaccine. It relies on more traditional virus-blocking technology than the Moderna or Pfizer shots, which use messenger RNA.

“We are basically saying, ‘Why are you not taking the vaccine? Have you thought about Novavax? It’s manufactured like the flu vaccine,’” Dr. Gaur said.

For the first time, nursing home residents will be offered a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V. The virus causes the hospitalizations of as many as 160,000 people over age 65 each year, killing up to 10,000. Most nursing homes are coupling the flu vaccine with either the Covid vaccine or the R.S.V. vaccine, but are not attempting to give all three simultaneously.

Dr. Gaur said that the novelty of the vaccine and people’s relative unfamiliarity with R.S.V. meant that clinicians would need to spend more time explaining the reason for the shots.

Spurgeon Manor, the nursing home where Ms. Wityk lives, is partnering with the pharmacy at a nearby Hy-Vee grocery store to provide the Covid shot, most likely in early October, to 85 residents of the home and an adjoining assisted living center as well as employees.

Alana Marean, its assistant director of nursing, said that workers would be encouraged to receive the shots, but she guessed that not even half would do so. “There’s a lot of stigma out there about it,” she said.

Lee Giese, 95, a retired truck driver who lives at the home, said he was looking forward to the latest shot after coming down with Covid last winter. He said he believed his earlier vaccinations helped protect him from more serious symptoms.

He said he expected most residents of his facility would get the shots, but a few would refuse. “Some people have a death wish,” he said.

"Dating After 60: A Lot of Roses, Some Thorns
For “The Golden Bachelor” and other singles of a certain age, there may be bad dates and false starts. But romance can be infinitely better after decades of life experience.

When Janet Ha, 65, first tried online dating in February, she found it “confusing and weird.”

Her son’s 20-something ex helped her make a profile on Bumble, but all of her initial matches were focused on hooking up.

“I had checked ‘something casual’ — because I didn’t think I was looking for a relationship — but I didn’t realize what that meant on Bumble,” Ms. Ha said, laughing.

She quickly learned to navigate the app, but still wasn’t sure what she wanted. Her nearly 30-year marriage had ended in divorce, and her children were grown. “I just did not want to have to take care of anybody anymore,” said Ms. Ha, a teacher from Minnesota who plans to retire in the spring of 2024.

Dating among older Americans is in the spotlight thanks to the upcoming premiere of “The Golden Bachelor,” which follows Gerry Turner, a 72-year-old widower, on his quest to find a partner in a “Bachelor” spinoff show featuring singles age 60 and older. (Ideally, Mr. Turner has said, a “high-energy” partner who might like pickleball or golf.)

‘The Bachelor’ Goes Golden
The ABC franchise’s first “Golden Bachelor” starred a retiree from Indiana and a group of women who are 60 and older vying for his attention.
A Fresh Take: “The Bachelor” has generated myriad spinoffs. The latest iteration stood apart, as it focused on a demographic that has been largely ignored in the world of dating shows.
The Lead: As the first “Golden Bachelor,” Gerry Turner, 72, hoped for a second chance at love. Here is how he landed the role.
The Final Rose: In the finale, Turner proposed to a woman he bonded with early in the season. The new couple then announced that they planned to marry in a televised ceremony.
Watch Party: The commentary was sharp and the drinks were virgin at a screening of the premiere hosted by the Oakland Senior Center.
Though reality TV is unlikely to reflect the typical experiences of older single people, millions of them are looking for love — and their stories are often overlooked. Older daters face all of the challenges their younger counterparts do — burnout, ghosting, gaslighting — but many of them have found that dating can be infinitely better when you don’t have as much to prove.

The prevailing narrative surrounding the growing number of unmarried older adults tends to focus on the risks of isolation and loneliness. But Sindy Oh, a licensed clinical psychologist in Los Angeles, said she was struck by how different dating can be for her older clients because they have a much stronger sense of self. “They have accepted who they are, and they are presenting themselves as is,” she said.

‘Mind-blowing Sex’
Though Ms. Ha’s introduction to online dating was inauspicious, four months ago she swiped right on Mike Ecker, 64, a divorced electrician from Wisconsin.

Had they met when they were in their 20s, Ms. Ha said, “I don’t think I would have been attracted to him, and I don’t think he would have been attracted to me,” describing herself as a “city girl” and Mr. Ecker as a “rural guy.” But their rapport formed easily and instantaneously. Whenever Ms. Ha matched with someone, she asked what song the person was “vibing to.” Mr. Ecker sent “Invisible” by Trey Anastasio. It felt like a sign, as Ms. Ha had been thinking a lot about the invisibility of older women.

On their third date, Ms. Ha drove three hours from her home to his so they could spend the weekend together. They have spent nearly every weekend together since, playing Yahtzee and cribbage, cooking and having what Ms. Ha described as “mind-blowing” sex. (The secret, she said, is good communication.)

“We are really open to talking about everything in a way that I have never experienced before,” Ms. Ha said. “I used to be afraid to show who I really was in a relationship before, because they might leave. And I don’t have that at all anymore.”

‘Shot Out of a Cannon’
One in three baby boomers is single, said Susan Brown, a distinguished professor of sociology at Bowling Green State University who studies demographic shifts in marriage and divorce, and an estimated 14 percent of single people between the ages of 57 and 85 are in a “dating relationship.”

David, 61, described feeling like he was “shot out of a cannon” when he began dating after his marriage of 25 years ended in divorce. He said he had found the “loneliness of a cold marriage even lonelier than being alone,” and is now experimenting with polyamory and nonmonogamy. He’d had inklings of these things during his largely sexless marriage, but never felt like he could explore those sides of himself, and described the confidence he now feels as “a remarkable feature of mid-life dating.” (David asked that only his first name be used out of respect for his ex-wife’s privacy.)

“One thing I quickly discovered is ‘Wow, you really don’t have to play any games at this point in life,’” said David, who lives in California. “I don’t have to tell any story that’s not true about me. And neither do they.”

Kathy Denton, 64, said she felt “bolder” now, in part because she no longer experiences the pressure she once did to settle down. She has been able to find fun with some of the men she has met through dating sites, even if none have been a long-term match. One “delightful man” cooked her “the best soups and breakfasts”; another swept her off to his condo in Florida and showed her “how to have fun again.”

Ms. Denton would like to fall in love again, but she has also “fallen in love” with herself, she said, and realizes that she is the only company she needs. She goes to the beach, spends time with friends and plans to enroll in a stained glass-making class. “If I had to spend the rest of my life alone, I’d be fine with it now,” said Ms. Denton, who lives in Michigan. “I love my life.”

‘We Need a Lot of Patience’
Dating after 60 isn’t all roses. Several people interviewed for this article mentioned how frustrating it is to meet people whose toxic behaviors have calcified over decades.

“We need a lot of patience with each other to undo some of this crap we’ve been through,” said Ms. Denton, who added that she had dated men who turned out to be compulsive liars, or who she suspected had alcohol issues. She has interacted with men who clearly did not bother to read her profile, she said, and others who sent naked photos. Some daters also brought up sexual dysfunction, the shrinking dating pool for older women and the threat of being scammed.

But for Ms. Ha and Mr. Ecker, opening themselves up to each other has brought them both surprising happiness at this stage in their lives. Mr. Ecker had been dating off and on for 10 years before he met Ms. Ha, and was coming out of a particularly difficult stretch when they connected. His mother and his beloved dog had both died, he had ended a three-year relationship and he had lost a chunk of his savings to stock market volatility, just as he was preparing to retire.

Now, he and Ms. Ha are planning the next stage of their lives together, thinking about what they want retirement to look like. They feel lucky to have found one another. “Ever since that first message she sent me,” he said. “I have felt that this thing has been guided and out of our control.”"
