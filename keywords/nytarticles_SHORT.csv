"Pharmacies Shared Patient Records Without a Warrant, an Inquiry Finds
A congressional investigation found that the nation’s largest pharmacies have handed over prescription records to law enforcement without a warrant, raising privacy concerns.
Law enforcement agencies have obtained the prescription records of thousands of Americans from the country’s largest pharmacy chains without a warrant, a congressional inquiry found, raising concerns about how the companies handle patient privacy.

Three of the largest pharmacy groups — CVS Health, Kroger and Rite Aid — do not require their staff members to contact a lawyer before releasing information requested by law enforcement, the inquiry found. The other five — Walgreens, Cigna, Optum Rx, Walmart and Amazon — said that they do require a legal review before honoring such requests.

The policies were revealed on Tuesday in a letter to Xavier Becerra, the secretary of health and human services, from Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representatives Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Sara Jacobs of California, all Democrats.

The inquiry began in June, a year after the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion and cleared the way for Republican-controlled states to enact near-total bans on the procedure. Reproductive health advocates and some lawmakers have since raised privacy concerns regarding access to birth control and abortion medication.

“Although pharmacies are legally permitted to tell their customers about government demands for their data, most don’t,” the lawmakers wrote. “As a result, many Americans’ prescription records have few meaningful privacy protections, and those protections vary widely depending on which pharmacy they use.”

The inquiry found that the pharmacies receive tens of thousands of legal requests annually for their patients’ pharmacy records. However, the letter said, the companies indicated that a vast majority of the requests were submitted in connection with civil litigation.

In July, nearly 50 Democratic members of Congress wrote to Mr. Becerra to urge the Health and Human Services Department to expand regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, that would require law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant to gain access to medical records and would require that patients be notified when their records are requested.

Since then, lawmakers have been digging into the disclosure practices of major pharmacy chains.

During the congressional inquiry, CVS, Kroger and Rite Aid “indicated that their pharmacy staff face extreme pressure to immediately respond to law enforcement demands and, as such, the companies instruct their staff to process those requests in the store,” Mr. Wyden, Ms. Jayapal and Ms. Jacobs wrote in their letter to Mr. Becerra.

“Americans’ prescription records are among the most private information the government can obtain about a person,” the lawmakers wrote. “They can reveal extremely personal and sensitive details about a person’s life.”

It went on to urge the Health and Human Services Department to strengthen the regulations under HIPAA “to more closely align them with Americans’ reasonable expectations of privacy and constitutional principles.”

“Pharmacies can and should insist on a warrant, and invite law enforcement agencies that insist on demanding patient medical records with solely a subpoena to go to court to enforce that demand,” the letter said.

In a statement, a CVS spokeswoman said that the company’s “processes are consistent with HIPAA” and that its pharmacy teams are trained to “appropriately respond to lawful requests.”

“We have suggested a warrant or judge-issued subpoena requirement be considered and we look forward to working cooperatively with Congress to strengthen patient privacy protections,” the spokeswoman, Amy Thibault, said.

The Health and Human Services Department has already taken steps to add language to HIPAA that would protect data involving reproductive health. In April, the department’s Office for Civil Rights proposed a rule that would bar health care providers and insurers from turning over information to state officials who are trying to prosecute someone for seeking or providing a legal abortion.

Michelle Mello, a professor of law and health policy at Stanford, said that requiring a warrant instead of a subpoena for the release of pharmacy records would “not necessarily preclude concerns” about privacy. She also said that notifying patients about record disclosures, which the lawmakers said “would be a major step forward for patient transparency,” would likely occur only after the fact.

While Professor Mello said most pharmacy records should be kept private, she said that targeting pharmacy employees, who could be found in contempt of court for not complying with a law enforcement demand for records, adds another layer of complexity.

“It’s not fair to put the onus on them to be found in contempt of court and then fight that,” she said.

But efforts by congressional Democrats to shore up HIPAA reveal a longstanding misconception about the health care privacy law, which was signed into law in 1996, she said.

“People think HIPAA has broader protection than it does,” Professor Mello said. “It wasn’t designed to enable health care providers to resist very misguided, in my view, attempts to enforce laws that impact patients in a negative way.”

"Supreme Court Will Hear Challenge to Abortion Pill Access
The justices announced that they would hear a case challenging a federal agency’s approval of the commonly used pill.
The Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it would decide on the availability of a commonly used abortion pill, the first major case involving abortion on its docket since it overturned the constitutional right to the procedure more than a year ago.

The Biden administration had asked the justices to intervene after a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit favored curbing distribution of the drug, mifepristone, appearing skeptical of the Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the pill in recent years. In its ruling, the panel said that the pill would remain legal, but with significant restrictions on patients’ access, including prohibiting the medication from being sent by mail or prescribed by telemedicine.

The move sets up a high-stakes fight over the drug that could sharply curtail access to the medication, even in states where abortion remains legal. It could also have implications for the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration, which approved the pill more than two decades ago.

The Supreme Court is now in the unusual position of ruling on abortion access even after its conservative majority declared that it would leave that question to elected officials. Until the court issues a decision, the F.D.A.’s approval of the drug remains in place, delaying the potential for abrupt limits on a medication that is used in more than half of all pregnancy terminations in the United States.

The Supreme Court did not set a date for argument but is expected to issue a decision by the end of its term, in late June. That means a ruling could arrive at the heart of the campaign season, during which abortion is expected to be a centerpiece of Democratic platforms.

Abortion rights groups welcomed the court’s decision to hear the case.

“The stakes are enormous in post-Roe America,” Nancy Northup, the president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy organization, said in a statement.

Alliance Defending Freedom, the group that is representing those challenging the F.D.A.’s authority, said in a statement that the court would help settle whether “the F.D.A. has harmed the health of women and undermined the rule of law by illegally removing every meaningful safeguard from the chemical abortion drug regimen.”

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, the battle over abortion has largely played out in the states, where it remains a potent political and legal issue.

More than a dozen states have enacted bans or restrictions, and Democrats have seized on the fallout from the ruling to galvanize voters at the polls, even in conservative-leaning states. In Texas, a woman sought an emergency court order to receive an abortion but ultimately was denied by the state’s Supreme Court and left the state to undergo the procedure. And in Ohio, voters in November soundly approved a ballot measure that enshrined a right to abortion in its constitution. The success of similar campaigns has inspired efforts in Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania.

The justices had discussed the case at their Friday conference, the private meeting among the nine. They will hear two consolidated cases challenging more recent changes the F.D.A. made starting in 2016 to expand distribution of the drug, F.D.A. v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, No. 23-235, and Danco Laboratories v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, No. 23-236.

In asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, lawyers for the Justice Department described the ruling by the appeals court as unprecedented in questioning the expert judgment of the F.D.A. Such a decision, they added, “would threaten to severely disrupt the pharmaceutical industry and prevent F.D.A. from fulfilling its statutory responsibilities according to its scientific judgment.”

Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal advocacy organization that has brought cases for clients opposed to abortion and gay and transgender rights, represents the challengers. In a brief, lawyers for the group argued that the Supreme Court did not need to weigh in, calling the appeals court decision a “modest decision” that “merely restores the common-sense safeguards under which millions of women have taken chemical abortion drugs.”

The tangled showdown over the future of the pill reflects how medication abortion has become the next major battlefront for conservative groups.

The case began in November last year, when an umbrella group of anti-abortion medical organizations and a few doctors filed a lawsuit describing the F.D.A.’s approval as flawed and questioning the safety of the drug.

Many studies of mifepristone have found it to be highly safe and effective, and years of research have shown that serious complications are rare. Fewer than 1 percent of patients need hospitalization, medical experts have said.

The drug, the first in a two-part regimen, has been used by more than five million people in the United States and is approved for use in dozens of countries. Under the current F.D.A. regulatory framework for mifepristone, it has been regulated more strictly and studied more strenuously than most other drugs.

The group filed its challenge in the Panhandle city of Amarillo, Texas, where only one federal judge hears civil lawsuits filed there, Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who is a longtime opponent of abortion.

In April, Judge Kacsmaryk issued a preliminary ruling invalidating the F.D.A.’s approval of the drug. Days later, a panel of three judges in the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, struck down part of his ruling, allowing the drug to remain on the market but with restrictions.

The Justice Department was among those that sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, which temporarily paused any changes to the drug’s availability as an appeal made its way up through the lower courts.

A different three-judge panel in the Fifth Circuit ruled in August that the F.D.A.’s original approval of mifepristone should remain in place, as should its approval of a generic version in 2019.

But it rolled back regulations governing the pill, to before 2016. In the years since, the agency made changes that broadened access to the drug. Under those pre-2016 rules, mifepristone must be prescribed only by a doctor and picked up in person. Patients also had to visit a doctor three times during the abortion process."
